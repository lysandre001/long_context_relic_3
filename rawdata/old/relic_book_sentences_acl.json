{"the_scarlet_letter": ["It is a little remarkable, that-though disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends-an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me, in addressing the public. ", "The first time was three or four years since, when I favored the reader-inexcusably, and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine-with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an Old Manse. ", "And now-because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion-I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three years' experience in a Custom-House. ", "The example of the famous \"P. P., Clerk of this Parish,\" was never more faithfully followed. ", "The truth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him, better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. ", "Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed, only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; ", "as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer's own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it. ", "It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally. ", "But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk; ", "and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. ", "To this extent, and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical, without violating either the reader's rights or his own. ", "It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain propriety, of a kind always recognized in literature, as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained. ", "This, in fact,-a desire to put myself in my true position as editor, or very little more, of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volume,-this, and no other, is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public. ", "In accomplishing the main purpose, it has appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described, together with some of the characters that move in it, among whom the author happened to make one. ", "In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,-but which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life; ", "except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its melancholy length, discharging hides; ", "or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood,-at the head, I say, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass,-here, with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbor, stands a spacious edifice of brick. ", "From the loftiest point of its roof, during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; ", "but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam's government is here established. ", "Its front is ornamented with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. ", "Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw. ", "With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; ", "and especially to warn all citizens, careful of their safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings. ", "Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle; ", "imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. ", "But she has no great tenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,-oftener soon than late,-is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows. ", "The pavement round about the above-described edifice-which we may as well name at once as the Custom-House of the port-has grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn by any multitudinous resort of business. ", "In some months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread. ", "Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by itself; ", "not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their ventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at New York or Boston. ", "On some such morning, when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once,-usually from Africa or South America,-or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the granite steps. ", "Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel's papers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box. ", "Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful or sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of. ", "Here, likewise,-the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, care-worn merchant,-we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his master's ships, when he had better be sailing mimic-boats upon a mill-pond. ", "Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor in quest of a protection; ", "or the recently arrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital. ", "Nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the British provinces; ", "a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the alertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade. ", "Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. ", "More frequently, however, on ascending the steps, you would discern-in the entry, if it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms, if wintry or inclement weather-a row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. ", "Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own independent exertions. ", "These old gentlemen-seated, like Matthew, at the receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands-were Custom-House officers. ", "Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a certain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty height; ", "with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow lane, and along a portion of Derby Street. ", "All three give glimpses of the shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers; ", "around the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. ", "The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; ", "its floor is strewn with gray sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse; ", "and it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very infrequent access. ", "In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; ", "an old pine desk, with a three-legged stool beside it; ", "two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; ", "and-not to forget the library-on some shelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue Laws. ", "A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice. ", "And here, some six months ago,-pacing from corner to corner, or lounging on the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper,-you might have recognized, honored reader, the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches, on the western side of the Old Manse. ", "But now, should you go thither to seek him, you would inquire in vain for the Locofoco Surveyor. ", "The besom of reform has swept him out of office; ", "and a worthier successor wears his dignity, and pockets his emoluments. ", "This old town of Salem-my native place, though I have dwelt much away from it, both in boyhood and maturer years-possesses, or did possess, a hold on my affections, the force of which I have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here. ", "Indeed, so far as its physical aspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, covered chiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty,-its irregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but only tame,-its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the almshouse at the other,-such being the features of my native town, it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checker-board. ", "And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. ", "The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil. ", "It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a city. ", "And here his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled their earthy substance with the soil; ", "until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. ", "In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. ", "Few of my countrymen can know what it is; ", "nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know. ", "But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. ", "The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember. ", "It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town. ", "I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned progenitor,-who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man of war and peace,-a stronger claim than for myself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. ", "He was a soldier, legislator, judge; ", "he was a ruler in the Church; ", "he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. ", "He was likewise a bitter persecutor, as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these were many. ", "His son, too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him. ", "So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! ", "I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; ", "or ", "whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them, in another state of being. ", "At all events, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them-as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist-may be now and henceforth removed. ", "Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself. ", "No aim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable; ", "no success of mine-if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success-would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. ", "\" What is he? ", "\" murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. ", "\" A writer of story-books! ", "What kind of a business in life-what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation-may that be? ", "Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!\" ", "Such are the compliments bandied between my great-grandsires and myself, across the gulf of time! ", "And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine. ", "Planted deep, in the town's earliest infancy and childhood, by these two earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here; ", "always, too, in respectability; ", "never, so far as I have known, disgraced by a single unworthy member; ", "but seldom or never, on the other hand, after the first two generations, performing any memorable deed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice. ", "Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; ", "as old houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. ", "From father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the sea; ", "a gray-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had blustered against his sire and grandsire. ", "The boy, also, in due time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. ", "This long connection of a family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him. ", "It is not love, but instinct. ", "The new inhabitant-who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came-has little claim to be called a Salemite; ", "he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have been imbedded. ", "It is no matter that the place is joyless for him; ", "that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;-all these, and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. ", "The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise. ", "So has it been in my case. ", "I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; ", "so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here,-ever, as one representative of the race lay down in his grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main street,-might still in my little day be seen and recognized in the old town. ", "Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the connection, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be severed. ", "Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. ", "My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth. ", "On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town, that brought me to fill a place in Uncle Sam's brick edifice, when I might as well, or better, have gone somewhere else. ", "My doom was on me. ", "It was not the first time, nor the second, that I had gone away,-as ", "it seemed, permanently,-but yet returned, like the bad half-penny; ", "or ", "as if Salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. ", "So, one fine morning, I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the President's commission in my pocket, and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief executive officer of the Custom-House. ", "I doubt greatly-or, rather, I do not doubt at all-whether any public functionary of the United States, either in the civil or military line, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself. ", "The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once settled, when I looked at them. ", "For upwards of twenty years before this epoch, the independent position of the Collector had kept the Salem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile. ", "A soldier,-New England's most distinguished soldier,-he stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services; ", "and, himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office, he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heart-quake. ", "General Miller was radically conservative; ", "a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence; ", "attaching himself strongly to familiar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement. ", "Thus, on taking charge of my department, I found few but aged men. ", "They were ancient sea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tost on every sea, and standing up sturdily against life's tempestuous blasts, had finally drifted into this quiet nook; ", "where, with little to disturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidential election, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence. ", "Though by no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. ", "Two or three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bedridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House, during a large part of the year; ", "but, after a torpid winter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go lazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and convenience, betake themselves to bed again. ", "I must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic. ", "They were allowed, on my representation, to rest from their arduous labors, and soon afterwards-as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their country's service, as I verily believe it was-withdrew to a better world. ", "It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference, a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. ", "Neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise. ", "The greater part of my officers were Whigs. ", "It was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and though a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services. ", "Had it been otherwise,-had an active politician been put into this influential post, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector, whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his office,-hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life, within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the Custom-House steps. ", "According to the received code in such matters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine. ", "It was plain enough to discern, that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands. ", "It pained, and at the same time amused me, to behold the terrors that attended my advent; ", "to see a furrowed cheek, weather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself; ", "to detect, as one or another addressed me, the tremor of a voice, which, in long-past days, had been wont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frighten Boreas himself to silence. ", "They knew, these excellent old persons, that, by all established rule,-and, as regarded some of them, weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business,-they ought to have given place to younger men, more orthodox in politics, and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common Uncle. ", "I knew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. ", "Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps. ", "They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the wall; ", "awaking, however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them. ", "The discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no great harm in him. ", "So, with lightsome hearts, and the happy consciousness of being usefully employed,-in their own behalf, at least, if not for our beloved country,-these good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office. ", "Sagaciously, under their spectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels! ", "Mighty was their fuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers! ", "Whenever such a mischance occurred,-when a wagon-load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses,-nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel. ", "Instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution, after the mischief had happened; ", "a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal, the moment that there was no longer any remedy. ", "Unless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them. ", "The better part of my companion's character, if it have a better part, is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognize the man. ", "As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits, and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective, was favorable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like them all. ", "It was pleasant, in the summer ", "forenoons,-when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half-torpid systems,-it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; ", "while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips. ", "Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; ", "the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humor, has little to do with the matter; ", "it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch, and gray, mouldering trunk. ", "In one case, however, it is real sunshine; ", "in the other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood. ", "It would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage. ", "In the first place, my coadjutors were not invariably old; ", "there were men among them in their strength and prime, of marked ability and energy, and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them. ", "Then, moreover, the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair. ", "But, as respects the majority of my corps of veterans, there will be no wrong done, if I characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life. ", "They seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting, and most carefully to have stored their memories with the husks. ", "They spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning's breakfast, or yesterday's, to-day's, or to-morrow's dinner, than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the world's wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes. ", "The father of the Custom-House-the patriarch, not only of this little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of tide-waiters all over the United States-was a certain permanent Inspector. ", "He might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system, dyed in the wool, or, rather, born in the purple; ", "since his sire, a Revolutionary colonel, and formerly collector of the port, had created an office for him, and appointed him to fill it, at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember. ", "This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime's search. ", "With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed-not young, indeed-but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. ", "His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man's utterance; ", "they came strutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion. ", "Looking at him merely as an animal,-and there was very little else to look at,-he was a most satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at, or conceived of. ", "The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him. ", "The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; ", "these latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all-fours. ", "He possessed no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities; ", "nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart. ", "He had been the husband of three wives, all long since dead; ", "the father of twenty children, most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust. ", "Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a sable tinge. ", "Not so with our old Inspector! ", "One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences. ", "The next moment, he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant; ", "far readier than the Collector's junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder and graver man of the two. ", "I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I think, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice. ", "He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; ", "so perfect, in one point of view; ", "so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other. ", "My conclusion was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; ", "nothing, as I have already said, but instincts: ", "and yet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together, that there was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with what I found in him. ", "It might be difficult-and it was so-to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; ", "but surely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath, had been not unkindly given; ", "with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age. ", "One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. ", "His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; ", "and to hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. ", "As he possessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher's meat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. ", "His reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils. ", "There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. ", "I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms. ", "It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him; ", "not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual. ", "A tender-loin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered; ", "while all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. ", "The chief tragic event of the old man's life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago; ", "a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no impression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw. ", "But it is time to quit this sketch; ", "on which, however, I should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because, of all men whom I have ever known, this individual was fittest to be a Custom-House officer. ", "Most persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to hint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. ", "The old Inspector was incapable of it, and, were he to continue in office to the end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite. ", "There is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-House portraits would be strangely incomplete; ", "but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline. ", "It is that of the Collector, our gallant old General, who, after his brilliant military service, subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild Western territory, had come hither, twenty years before, to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life. ", "The brave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his threescore years and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march, burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit-stirring recollections could do little towards lightening. ", "The step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge. ", "It was only with the assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascend the Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace. ", "There he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went; ", "amid the rustle of papers, the administering of oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual talk of the office; ", "all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation. ", "His countenance, in this repose, was mild and kindly. ", "If his notice was sought, an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features; ", "proving that there was light within him, and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage. ", "The closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. ", "When no longer called upon to speak, or listen, either of which operations cost him an evident effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude. ", "It was not painful to behold this look; ", "for, though dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. ", "The framework of his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin. ", "To observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its gray and broken ruins. ", "Here and there, perchance, the walls may remain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of peace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds. ", "Nevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection,-for, slight as was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be termed so,-I could discern the main points of his portrait. ", "It was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished name. ", "His spirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by an uneasy activity; ", "it must, at any period of his life, have required an impulse to set him in motion; ", "but, once stirred up, with obstacles to overcome, and an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the man to give out or fail. ", "The heat that had formerly pervaded his nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze; ", "but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace. ", "Weight, solidity, firmness; ", "this was the expression of his repose, even in such decay as had crept untimely over him, at the period of which I speak. ", "But I could imagine, even then, that, under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,-roused by a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all his energies that were not dead, but only slumbering,-he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown, dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and starting up once more a warrior. ", "And, in so intense a moment, his demeanor would have still been calm. ", "Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; ", "not to be anticipated, nor desired. ", "What I saw in him-as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile-were the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; ", "of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; ", "and of benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewa or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age. ", "He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I know,-certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy;-but, be that as it might, there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly's wing. ", "I have not known the man to whose innate kindliness I would more confidently make an appeal. ", "Many characteristics-and those, too, which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch-must have vanished, or been obscured, before I met the General. ", "All merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent; ", "nor ", "does Nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty, that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay, as she sows wall-flowers over the ruined fortress of Ticonderoga. ", "Still, even in respect of grace and beauty, there were points well worth noting. ", "A ray of humor, now and then, would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. ", "A trait of native elegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth, was shown in the General's fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers. ", "An old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow; ", "but here was one who seemed to have a young girl's appreciation of the floral tribe. ", "There, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; ", "while the Surveyor-though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation-was fond of standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance. ", "He seemed away from us, although we saw him but a few yards off; ", "remote, though we passed close beside his chair; ", "unattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own. ", "It might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the Collector's office. ", "The evolutions of the parade; ", "the tumult of the battle; ", "the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years before;-such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his intellectual sense. ", "Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors, entered and departed; ", "the bustle of this commercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmur round about him; ", "and neither with the men nor their affairs did the General appear to sustain the most distant relation. ", "He was as much out of place as an old sword-now rusty, but which had flashed once in the battle's front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade-would have been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on the Deputy Collector's desk. ", "There was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re-creating the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,-the man of true and simple energy. ", "It was the recollection of those memorable words of his,-\"I'll try, Sir!\"-spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise, and breathing the soul and spirit of New England hardihood, comprehending all perils, and encountering all. ", "If, in our country, valor were rewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase-which it seems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and glory before him, has ever spoken-would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the General's shield of arms. ", "It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. ", "The accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office. ", "There was one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent. ", "His gifts were emphatically those of a man of business; ", "prompt, acute, clear-minded; ", "with an eye that saw through all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish, as by the waving of an enchanter's wand. ", "Bred up from boyhood in the Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity; ", "and the many intricacies of business, so harassing to the interloper, presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system. ", "In my contemplation, he stood as the ideal of his class. ", "He was, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; ", "or, at all events, the main-spring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion; ", "for, in an institution like this, where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. ", "Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts steel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with. ", "With an easy condescension, and kind forbearance towards our stupidity,-which, to his order of mind, must have seemed little short of crime,-would he forthwith, by the merest touch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight. ", "The merchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric friends. ", "His integrity was perfect: ", "it was a law of nature with him, rather than a choice or a principle; ", "nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his, to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs. ", "A stain on his conscience, as to anything that came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, that an error in the balance of an account or an ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. ", "Here, in a word,-and it is a rare instance in my life,-I had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held. ", "Such were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. ", "I took it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits, and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had. ", "After my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of Brook Farm; ", "after living for three years within the subtile influence of an intellect like Emerson's; ", "after those wild, free days on the Assabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside our fire of fallen boughs, with Ellery Channing; ", "after talking with Thoreau about pine-trees and Indian relics, in his hermitage at Walden; ", "after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of Hillard's culture; ", "after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at Longfellow's hearthstone;-it was time, at length, that I should exercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself with food for which I had hitherto had little appetite. ", "Even the old Inspector was desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who had known Alcott. ", "I look upon it as an evidence, in some measure, of a system naturally well balanced, and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization, that, with such associates to remember, I could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities, and never murmur at the change. ", "Literature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment in my regard. ", "I cared not, at this period, for books; ", "they were apart from me. ", "Nature,-except it were human nature,-the nature that is developed in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; ", "and all the imaginative delight, wherewith it had been spiritualized, passed away out of my mind. ", "A gift, a faculty if it had not departed, was suspended and inanimate within me. ", "There would have been something sad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. ", "It might be true, indeed, that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long; ", "else, it might have made me permanently other than I had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take. ", "But I never considered it as other than a transitory life. ", "There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come. ", "Meanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue, and, so far as I have been able to understand, as good a Surveyor as need be. ", "A man of thought, fancy, and sensibility (had he ten times the Surveyor's proportion of those qualities) may, at any time, be a man of affairs, if he will only choose to give himself the trouble. ", "My fellow-officers, and the merchants and sea-captains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection, viewed me in no other light, and probably knew me in no other character. ", "None of them, I presume, had ever read a page of my inditing, or would have cared a fig the more for me, if they had read them all; ", "nor would it have mended the matter, in the least, had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of Burns or of Chaucer, each of whom was a custom-house officer in his day, as well as I. ", "It is a good lesson-though it may often be a hard one-for a man who has dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized, and to find how utterly devoid of significance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at. ", "I know not that I especially needed the lesson, either in the way of warning or rebuke; ", "but, at any rate, I learned it thoroughly: ", "nor, it gives me pleasure to reflect, did the truth, as it came home to my perception, ever cost me a pang, or require to be thrown off in a sigh. ", "In the way of literary talk, it is true, the Naval Officer-an excellent fellow, who came into office with me and went out only a little later-would often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favorite topics, Napoleon or Shakespeare. ", "The Collector's junior clerk, too-a young gentleman who, it was whispered, occasionally covered a sheet of Uncle Sam's letter-paper with what (at the distance of a few yards) looked very much like poetry-used now and then to speak to me of books, as matters with which I might possibly be conversant. ", "This was my all of lettered intercourse; ", "and it was quite sufficient for my necessities. ", "No longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on title-pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue. ", "The Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. ", "Borne on such queer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a name conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and, I hope, will never go again. ", "But the past was not dead. ", "Once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active, yet had been put to rest so quietly, revived again. ", "One of the most remarkable occasions, when the habit of bygone days awoke in me, was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which I am now writing. ", "In the second story of the Custom-House there is a large room, in which the brick-work and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster. ", "The edifice-originally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port, and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized-contains far more space than its occupants know what to do with. ", "This airy hall, therefore, over the Collector's apartments, remains unfinished to this day, and, in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams, appears still to await the labor of the carpenter and mason. ", "At one end of the room, in a recess, were a number of barrels, piled one upon another, containing bundles of official documents. ", "Large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor. ", "It was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers, which were now only an encumbrance on earth, and were hidden away in this forgotten corner, never more to be glanced at by human eyes. ", "But, then, what reams of other manuscripts-filled not with the dulness of official formalities, but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts-had gone equally to oblivion; ", "and that, moreover, without serving a purpose in their day, as these heaped-up papers had, and-saddest of all-without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the Custom-House had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen! ", "Yet not altogether worthless, perhaps, as materials of local history. ", "Here, no doubt, statistics of the former commerce of Salem might be discovered, and memorials of her princely merchants,-old King Derby, old Billy Gray, old Simon Forrester, and many another magnate in his day; ", "whose powdered head, however, was scarcely in the tomb, before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle. ", "The founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of Salem might here be traced, from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic, at periods generally much posterior to the Revolution, upward to what their children look upon as long-established rank. ", "Prior to the Revolution there is a dearth of records; ", "the earlier documents and archives of the Custom-House having, probably, been carried off to Halifax, when all the King's officials accompanied the British army in its flight from Boston. ", "It has often been a matter of regret with me; ", "for, going back, perhaps, to the days of the Protectorate, those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men, and to antique customs, which would have affected me with the same pleasure as when I used to pick up Indian arrow-heads in the field near the Old Manse. ", "But, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest. ", "Poking and burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish in the corner; ", "unfolding one and another document, and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves, and those of merchants, never heard of now on 'Change, nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones; ", "glancing at such matters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activity,-and exerting my fancy, sluggish with little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old town's brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only Salem knew the way thither,-I chanced to lay my hand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment. ", "This envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past, when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present. ", "There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light. ", "Unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of his Majesty's Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. ", "I remember to have read (probably in Felt's Annals) a notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; ", "and likewise, in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of St. Peter's Church, during the renewal of that edifice. ", "Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of my respected predecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and some fragments of apparel, and a wig of majestic frizzle; ", "which, unlike the head that it once adorned, was in very satisfactory preservation. ", "But, on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop, I found more traces of Mr. Pue's mental part, and the internal operations of his head, than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself. ", "They were documents, in short, not official, but of a private nature, or at least written in his private capacity, and apparently with his own hand. ", "I could account for their being included in the heap of Custom-House lumber only by the fact that Mr. Pue's death had happened suddenly; ", "and ", "that these papers, which he probably kept in his official desk, had never come to the knowledge of his heirs, or were supposed to relate to the business of the revenue. ", "On the transfer of the archives to Halifax, this package, proving to be of no public concern, was left behind, and had remained ever since unopened. ", "The ancient Surveyor-being little molested, I suppose, at that early day, with business pertaining to his office-seems to have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian, and other inquisitions of a similar nature. ", "These supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust. ", "A portion of his facts, by the by, did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled \"MAIN STREET,\" included in the present volume. ", "The remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable, hereafter; ", "or not impossibly may be worked up, so far as they go, into a regular history of Salem, should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task. ", "Meanwhile, they shall be at the command of any gentleman, inclined, and competent, to take the unprofitable labor off my hands. ", "As a final disposition, I contemplate depositing them with the Essex Historical Society. ", "But the object that most drew my attention, in the mysterious package, was a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded. ", "There were traces about it of gold embroidery, which, however, was greatly frayed and defaced; ", "so that none, or very little, of the glitter was left. ", "It had been wrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework; ", "and the stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be recovered even by the process of picking out the threads. ", "This rag of scarlet cloth,-for time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a rag,-on careful examination, assumed the shape of a letter. ", "It was the capital letter A. ", "By an accurate measurement, each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length. ", "It had been intended, there could be no doubt, as an ornamental article of dress; ", "but how it was to be worn, or what rank, honor, and dignity, in by-past times, were signified by it, was a riddle which (so evanescent are the fashions of the world in these particulars) ", "I saw little hope of solving. ", "And yet it strangely interested me. ", "My eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter, and would not be turned aside. ", "Certainly, there was some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities, but evading the analysis of my mind. ", "While thus perplexed,-and cogitating, among other hypotheses, whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive, in order to take the eyes of Indians,-I happened to place it on my breast. ", "It seemed to me,-the reader may smile, but must not doubt my word,-it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensation not altogether physical, yet almost so, of burning heat; ", "and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot iron. ", "I shuddered, and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor. ", "In the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter, I had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper, around which it had been twisted. ", "This I now opened, and had the satisfaction to find, recorded by the old Surveyor's pen, a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair. ", "There were several foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester Prynne, who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors. ", "She had flourished during the period between the early days of Massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century. ", "Aged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative, remembered her, in their youth, as a very old, but not decrepit woman, of a stately and solemn aspect. ", "It had been her habit, from an almost immemorial date, to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse, and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might; ", "taking upon herself, likewise, to give advice in all matters, especially those of the heart; ", "by which means, as a person of such propensities inevitably must, she gained from many people the reverence due to an angel, but, I should imagine, was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance. ", "Prying further into the manuscript, I found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman, for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled \"THE SCARLET LETTER\"; ", "and it should be borne carefully in mind, that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of Mr. Surveyor Pue. ", "The original papers, together with the scarlet letter itself,-a most curious relic,-are still in my possession, and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever, induced by the great interest of the narrative ", ", may desire a sight of them. ", "I must not be understood as affirming, that, in the dressing up of the tale, and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it, I have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old Surveyor's half a dozen sheets of foolscap. ", "On the contrary, I have allowed myself, as to such points, nearly or altogether as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention. ", "What I contend for is the authenticity of the outline. ", "This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track. ", "There seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale. ", "It impressed me as if the ancient Surveyor, in his garb of a hundred years gone by, and wearing his immortal wig,-which was buried with him, but did not perish in the grave,-had met me in the deserted chamber of the Custom-House. ", "In his port was the dignity of one who had borne his Majesty's commission, and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendor that shone so dazzlingly about the throne. ", "How unlike, alas! ", "the hang-dog look of a republican official, who, as the servant of the people, feels himself less than the least, and below the lowest, of his masters. ", "With his own ghostly hand, the obscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol, and the little roll of explanatory manuscript. ", "With his own ghostly voice, he had exhorted me, on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards him,-who might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestor,-to bring his mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations before the public. \" ", "Do this,\" said the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, emphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorable wig,-\"do this, and the profit shall be all your own! ", "You will shortly need it; ", "for it is not in your days as it was in mine, when a man's office was a life-lease, and oftentimes an heirloom. ", "But, I charge you, in this matter of old Mistress Prynne, give to your predecessor's memory the credit which will be rightfully due!\" ", "And I said to the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, \"I will!\" ", "On Hester Prynne's story, therefore, I bestowed much thought. ", "It was the subject of my meditations for many an hour, while pacing to and fro across my room, or traversing, with a hundred-fold repetition, the long extent from the front-door of the Custom-House to the side-entrance, and back again. ", "Great were the weariness and annoyance of the old Inspector and the Weighers and Gaugers, whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps. ", "Remembering their own former habits, they used to say that the Surveyor was walking the quarter-deck. ", "They probably fancied that my sole object-and, indeed, the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motion-was, to get an appetite for dinner. ", "And to say the truth, an appetite, sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage, was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise. ", "So little adapted is the atmosphere of a custom-house to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility, that, had I remained there through ten Presidencies yet to come, I doubt whether the tale of \"The Scarlet Letter\" would ever have been brought before the public eye. ", "My imagination was a tarnished mirror. ", "It would not reflect, or only with miserable dimness, the figures with which I did my best to people it. ", "The characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that I could kindle at my intellectual forge. ", "They would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment, but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses, and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance. ", "\" What have you to do with us?\" that expression seemed to say. ", "\" The little power you might once have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone! ", "You have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold. ", "Go, then, and earn your wages!\" ", "In short, the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility, and not without fair occasion. ", "It was not merely during the three hours and a half which Uncle Sam claimed as his share of my daily life, that this wretched numbness held possession of me. ", "It went with me on my sea-shore walks, and rambles into the country, whenever-which was seldom and reluctantly-I bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of Nature, which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that I stepped across the threshold of the Old Manse. ", "The same torpor, as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort, accompanied me home, and weighed upon me in the chamber which I most absurdly termed my study. ", "Nor did it quit me, when, late at night, I sat in the deserted parlor, lighted only by the glimmering coal-fire and the moon, striving to picture forth imaginary scenes, which, the next day, might flow out on the brightening page in many-hued description. ", "If the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour, it might well be deemed a hopeless case. ", "Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so distinctly,-making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibility,-is a medium the most suitable for a romance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests. ", "There is the little domestic scenery of the well-known apartment; ", "the chairs, with each its separate individuality; ", "the centre-table, sustaining a work-basket, a volume or two, and an extinguished lamp; ", "the sofa; ", "the bookcase; ", "the picture on the wall;-all these details, so completely seen, are so spiritualized by the unusual light, that they seem to lose their actual substance, and become things of intellect. ", "Nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change, and acquire dignity thereby. ", "A child's shoe; ", "the doll, seated in her little wicker carriage; ", "the hobby-horse;-whatever, in a word, has been used or played with, during the day, is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness, though still almost as vividly present as by daylight. ", "Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other. ", "Ghosts might enter here, without affrighting us. ", "It would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise, were we to look about us and discover a form beloved, but gone hence, now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar, or had never once stirred from our fireside. ", "The somewhat dim coal-fire has an essential influence in producing the effect which I would describe. ", "It throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room, with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling, and a reflected gleam from the polish of the furniture. ", "This warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams, and communicates, as it were, a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up. ", "It converts them from snow-images into men and women.

", "In some other form, perhaps, I may hereafter develop these effects.

", "If he possess an unusual share of native energy, or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long upon him, his forfeited powers may be redeemable. ", "The ejected officer-fortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes, to struggle amid a struggling world-may return to himself, and become all that he has ever been. ", "But this seldom happens. ", "He usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin, and is then thrust out, with sinews all unstrung, to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may. ", "Conscious of his own infirmity,-that his tempered steel and elasticity are lost,-he forever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support external to himself. ", "His pervading and continual hope-a hallucination which, in the face of all discouragement, and making light of impossibilities, haunts him while he lives, and, I fancy, like the convulsive throes of the cholera, torments him for a brief space after death-is, that finally, and in no long time, by some happy coincidence of circumstances, he shall be restored to office. ", "This faith, more than anything else, steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking. ", "Why should he toil and moil, and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud, when, in a little while hence, the strong arm of his Uncle will raise and support him?

", "To confess the truth, it was my greatest apprehension,-as it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself, and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resign,-it was my chief trouble, therefore, that I was likely to grow gray and decrepit in the Surveyorship, and become much such another animal as the old Inspector. ", "Might it not, in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me, finally be with me as it was with this venerable friend,-to make the dinner-hour the nucleus of the day, and to spend the rest of it, as an old dog spends it, asleep in the sunshine or in the shade? ", "A dreary look-forward this, for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities!

", "But it is a strange experience, to a man of pride and sensibility, to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him, and by whom, since one or the other must needs happen, he would rather be injured than obliged. ", "Strange, too, for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest, to observe the blood-thirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects!

", "If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders, were a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors, it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads, and have thanked Heaven for the opportunity! ", "It appears to me-who have been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat-that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. ", "The Democrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them, and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare, which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it were weakness and cowardice to murmur at. ", "But the long habit of victory has made them generous. ", "They know how to spare, when they see occasion; ", "and when they strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed, but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; ", "nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off. ", "In short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I saw much reason to congratulate myself that I was on the losing side, rather than the triumphant one. ", "If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of partisans, I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; ", "nor was it without something like regret and shame, that, according to a reasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my Democratic brethren. ", "But who can see an inch into futurity, beyond his nose? ", "My own head was the first that fell! ", "The moment when a man's head drops off is seldom or never, I am inclined to think, precisely the most agreeable of his life. ", "Nevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it, if the sufferer will but make the best, rather than the worst, of the accident which has befallen him. ", "In my particular case, the consolatory topics were close at hand, and, indeed, had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them. ", "In view of my previous weariness of office, and vague thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, although beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered. ", "In the Custom-House, as before in the Old Manse, I had spent three years; ", "a term long enough to rest a weary brain; ", "long enough to break off old intellectual habits, and make room for new ones; ", "long enough, and too long, to have lived in an unnatural state, doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being, and withholding myself from toil that would, at least, have stilled an unquiet impulse in me. ", "Then, moreover, as regarded his unceremonious ejectment, the late Surveyor was not altogether ill-pleased to be recognized by the Whigs as an enemy; ", "since his inactivity in political affairs-his tendency to roam, at will, in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet, rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one another-had sometimes made it questionable with his brother Democrats whether he was a friend. ", "Now, after he had won the crown of martyrdom (though with no longer a head to wear it on), the point might be looked upon as settled. ", "Finally, little heroic as he was, it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand, than to remain a forlorn survivor, when so many worthier men were falling; ", "and, at last, after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration, to be compelled then to define his position anew, and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one. ", "Meanwhile the press had taken up my affair, and kept me, for a week or two, careering through the public prints, in my decapitated state, like Irving's Headless Horseman; ", "ghastly and grim, and longing to be buried, as a politically dead man ought. ", "So much for my figurative self. ", "The real human being, all this time, with his head safely on his shoulders, had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best; ", "and, making an investment in ink, paper, and steel-pens, had opened his long-disused writing-desk, and was again a literary man. ", "Now it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor, Mr. Surveyor Pue, came into play. ", "Rusty through long idleness, some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale, with an effect in any degree satisfactory.

", "This uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution, and still seething turmoil, in which the story shaped itself. ", "It is no indication, however, of a lack of cheerfulness in the writer's mind; ", "for he was happier, while straying through the gloom of these sunless fantasies, than at any time since he had quitted the Old Manse.

", "It could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit, on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment. ", "But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. ", "It might be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at the whipping-post. ", "It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man's fire-water had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest. ", "It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows. ", "In either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanor on the part of the spectators; ", "as befitted a people amongst whom religion and law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful. ", "Meagre, indeed, and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold. ", "On the other hand, a penalty, which, in our days, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself. ", "It was a circumstance to be noted, on the summer morning when our story begins its course, that the women, of whom there were several in the crowd, appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue. ", "The age had not so much refinement, that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways, and wedging their not unsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution. ", "Morally, as well as materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding, than in their fair descendants, separated from them by a series of six or seven generations; ", "for, throughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother has transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less force and solidity, than her own. ", "The women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. ", "They were her countrywomen; ", "and the beef and ale of their native land, with a moral diet not a whit more refined, entered largely into their composition. ", "The bright morning sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off island, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of New England.

", "\" The door of the jail being flung open from within, there appeared, in the first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim and grisly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and his staff of office in his hand. ", "This personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic code of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender. ", "Stretching forth the official staff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman, whom he thus drew forward; ", "until, on the threshold of the prison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character, and stepped into the open air, as if by her own free will. ", "She bore in her arms a child, a baby of some three months old, who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day; ", "because its existence, heretofore, had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon, or other darksome apartment of the prison. ", "When the young woman-the mother of this child-stood fully revealed before the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom; ", "not so much by an impulse of motherly affection, as that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which was wrought or fastened into her dress. ", "In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her towns-people and neighbors. ", "On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. ", "It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; ", "and ", "which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony. ", "The young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale. ", "She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. ", "She was lady-like, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days; ", "characterized by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the delicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace, which is now recognized as its indication. ", "And never had Hester Prynne appeared more lady-like, in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issued from the prison. ", "Those who had before known her, and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were astonished, and even startled, to perceive how her beauty shone out, and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped. ", "It may be true, that, to a sensitive observer, there was something exquisitely painful in it. ", "Her attire, which, indeed, she had wrought for the occasion, in prison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed to express the attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness of her mood, by its wild and picturesque peculiarity. ", "But the point which drew all eyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer,-so that both men and women, who had been familiarly acquainted with Hester Prynne, were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first time,-was that SCARLET LETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. ", "It had the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself. ", "\"She hath good skill at her needle, that's certain,\" remarked one of her female spectators; ", "but did ever a woman, before this brazen hussy, contrive such a way of showing it! ", "Why, gossips, what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates, and make a pride out of what they, worthy gentlemen, meant for a punishment?\" ", "\"It were well,\" muttered the most iron-visaged of the old dames, \"if we stripped Madam Hester's rich gown off her dainty shoulders; ", "and as for the red letter, which she hath stitched so curiously, I'll bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel, to make a fitter one!\" ", "\"O, peace, neighbors, peace!\" whispered their youngest companion; ", "\"do not let her hear you! ", "Not a stitch in that embroidered letter ", "but she has felt it in her heart. ", "\" The grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff. \" ", "Make way, good people, make way, in the King's name! ", "\" cried he. ", "Open a passage; ", "and, I promise ye, Mistress Prynne shall be set where man, woman, and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel, from this time till an hour past meridian. ", "A blessing on the righteous Colony of the Massachusetts, where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine! ", "Come along, Madam Hester, and show your scarlet letter in the market-place!\" ", "A lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. ", "Preceded by the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed men and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment. ", "A crowd of eager and curious school-boys, understanding little of the matter in hand, except that it gave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress, turning their heads continually to stare into her face, and at the winking baby in her arms, and at the ignominious letter on her breast. ", "It was no great distance, in those days, from the prison-door to the market-place. ", "Measured by the prisoner's experience, however, it might be reckoned a journey of some length; ", "for, haughty as her demeanor was, she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon. ", "In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it. ", "With almost a serene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place. ", "It stood nearly beneath the eaves of Boston's earliest church, and appeared to be a fixture there. ", "In fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine, which now, for two or three generations past, has been merely historical and traditionary among us, but was held, in the old time, to be as effectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of France. ", "It was, in short, the platform of the pillory; ", "and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline, so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp, and thus hold it up to the public gaze. ", "The very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron. ", "There can be no outrage, methinks, against our common nature,-whatever be the delinquencies of the individual,-no outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame; ", "as it was the essence of this punishment to do. ", "In Hester Prynne's instance, however, as not unfrequently in other cases, her sentence bore, that she should stand a certain time upon the platform, but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head, the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine. ", "Knowing well her part, she ascended a flight of wooden steps, and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude, at about the height of a man's shoulders above the street. ", "Had there been a Papist among the crowd of Puritans, he might have seen in this beautiful woman, so picturesque in her attire and mien, and with the infant at her bosom, an object to remind him of the image of Divine Maternity, which so many illustrious painters have vied with one another to represent; ", "something which should remind him, indeed, but only by contrast, of that sacred image of sinless motherhood, whose infant was to redeem the world. ", "Here, there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty, and the more lost for the infant that she had borne. ", "The scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature, before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering, at it. ", "The witnesses of Hester Prynne's disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity. ", "They were stern enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity, but had none of the heartlessness of another social state, which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present. ", "Even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsellors, a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town; ", "all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meeting-house, looking down upon the platform. ", "When such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle, without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning. ", "Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave. ", "The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her, and concentrated at her bosom. ", "It was almost intolerable to be borne. ", "Of an impulsive and passionate nature, she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult; ", "but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment, and herself the object. ", "Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude,-each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts,-Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile. ", "But, under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once. ", "Yet there were intervals when the whole scene, in which she was the most conspicuous object, seemed to vanish from her eyes, or, at least, glimmered indistinctly before them, like a mass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images. ", "Her mind, and especially her memory, was preternaturally active, and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town, on the edge of the Western wilderness; ", "other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeple-crowned hats. ", "Reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial, passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childish quarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, came swarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life; ", "one picture precisely as vivid as another; ", "as if all were of similar importance, or all alike a play. ", "Possibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit, to relieve itself, by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality. ", "Be that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track along which she had been treading, since her happy infancy. ", "Standing on that miserable eminence, she saw again her native village, in Old England, and her paternal home; ", "a decayed house of gray stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half-obliterated shield of arms over the portal, in token of antique gentility. ", "She saw her father's face, with its bald brow, and reverend white beard, that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; ", "her mother's, too, with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and which, even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughter's pathway. ", "She saw her own face, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. ", "There she beheld another countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books. ", "Yet those same bleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it was their owner's purpose to read the human soul. ", "This figure of the study and the cloister, as Hester Prynne's womanly fancy failed not to recall, was slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right. ", "Next rose before her, in memory's picture-gallery, the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, gray houses, the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of a Continental city; ", "where a new life had awaited her, still in connection with the misshapen scholar; ", "a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall. ", "Lastly, in lieu of these shifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the Puritan settlement, with all the towns-people assembled and levelling their stern regards at Hester Prynne,-yes, at herself,-who stood on the scaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letter A, in scarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold-thread, upon her bosom! ", "[Illustration: ", "Standing on the Miserable Eminence\"]  Could it be true? ", "She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast, that it sent forth a cry; ", "she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real. ", "Yes!-these were her realities,-all else had vanished! ", "[Illustration]                             III. ", "THE RECOGNITION. ", "From this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and universal observation, the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved, by discerning, on the outskirts of the crowd, a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts. ", "An Indian, in his native garb, was standing there; ", "but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the English settlements, that one of them would have attracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time; ", "much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind. ", "By the Indian's side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume. ", "He was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet, could hardly be termed aged. ", "There was a remarkable intelligence in his features, as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself, and become manifest by unmistakable tokens. ", "Although, by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb, he had endeavored to conceal or abate the peculiarity, it was sufficiently evident to Hester Prynne, that one of this man's shoulders rose higher than the other. ", "Again, at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage, and the slight deformity of the figure, she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain. ", "But the mother did not seem to hear it. ", "At his arrival in the market-place, and some time before she saw him, the stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. ", "It was carelessly, at first, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom external matters are of little value and import, unless they bear relation to something within his mind. ", "Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative. ", "A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight. ", "His face darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a single moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. ", "After a brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally subsided into the depths of his nature. ", "When he found the eyes of Hester Prynne fastened on his own, and saw that she appeared to recognize him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a gesture with it in the air, and laid it on his lips. ", "Then, touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood next to him, he addressed him, in a formal and courteous manner. ", "\"I pray you, good Sir,\" said he, \"who is this woman?-and wherefore is she here set up to public shame?\" ", "\"You must needs be a stranger in this region, friend,\" answered the townsman, looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion, \"else you would surely have heard of Mistress Hester Prynne, and her evil doings. ", "She hath raised a great scandal, I promise you, in godly Master Dimmesdale's church.\" ", "\"You say truly,\" replied the other. ", "\" I am a stranger, and have been a wanderer, sorely against my will. ", "I have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land, and have been long held in bonds among the heathen-folk, to the southward; ", "and am now brought hither by this Indian, to be redeemed out of my captivity. ", "Will it please you, therefore, to tell me of Hester Prynne's,-have ", "I her name rightly?-of this woman's offences, and what has brought her to yonder scaffold?\" ", "\"Truly, friend; ", "and methinks it must gladden your heart, after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness,\" said the townsman, \"to find yourself, at length, in a land where iniquity is searched out, and punished in the sight of rulers and people; ", "as here in our godly New England. ", "Yonder woman, Sir, you must know, was the wife of a certain learned man, English by birth, but who had long dwelt in Amsterdam, whence, some good time agone, he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the Massachusetts. ", "To this purpose, he sent his wife before him, remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs. ", "Marry, good Sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman has been a dweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this learned gentleman, Master Prynne; ", "and his young wife, look you, being left to her own misguidance-\"  \" ", "Ah!-aha!-I conceive you,\" said the stranger, with a bitter smile. ", "So learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books. ", "And who, by your favor, Sir, may be the father of yonder babe-it is some three or four months old, I should judge-which Mistress Prynne is holding in her arms?\" ", "\"Of a truth, friend, that matter remaineth a riddle; ", "and the Daniel who shall expound it is yet a-wanting,\" answered the townsman. \" ", "Madam Hester absolutely refuseth to speak, and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain. ", "Peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle, unknown of man, and forgetting that God sees him.\" ", "\"The learned man,\" observed the stranger, with another smile, \"should come himself, to look into the mystery.\" ", "\"It behooves him well, if he be still in life,\" responded the townsman. ", "\" Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall,-and that, moreover, as is most likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea,-they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her. ", "The penalty thereof is death. ", "But in their great mercy and tenderness of heart, they have doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainder of her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom.\" ", "\"A wise sentence!\" remarked the stranger, gravely bowing his head. ", "\"Thus she will be a living sermon against sin, until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone. ", "It irks me, nevertheless, that the partner of her iniquity should not, at least, stand on the scaffold by her side. ", "But he will be known!-he will be known!-he will be known!\" ", "He bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, and, whispering a few words to his Indian attendant, they both made their way through the crowd. ", "While this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing on her pedestal, still with a fixed gaze towards the stranger; ", "so fixed a gaze, that, at moments of intense absorption, all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish, leaving only him and her. ", "Such an interview, perhaps, would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did, with the hot, mid-day sun burning down upon her face, and lighting up its shame; ", "with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast; ", "with the sin-born infant in her arms; ", "with a whole people, drawn forth as to a festival, staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of a home, or beneath a matronly veil, at church. ", "Dreadful as it was, she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses. ", "It was better to stand thus, with so many betwixt him and her, than to greet him, face to face, they two alone. ", "She fled for refuge, as it were, to the public exposure, and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her. ", "Involved in these thoughts, she scarcely heard a voice behind her, until it had repeated her name more than once, in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole multitude. \" ", "Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!\" said the voice. ", "It has already been noticed, that directly over the platform on which Hester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or open gallery, appended to the meeting-house. ", "It was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made, amidst an assemblage of the magistracy, with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days. ", "Here, to witness the scene which we are describing, sat Governor Bellingham himself, with four sergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a guard of honor. ", "He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of embroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath; ", "a gentleman advanced in years, with a hard experience written in his wrinkles. ", "He was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community, which owed its origin and progress, and its present state of development, not to the impulses of youth, but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood, and the sombre sagacity of age; ", "accomplishing so much, precisely because it imagined and hoped so little. ", "The other eminent characters, by whom the chief ruler was surrounded, were distinguished by a dignity of mien, belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of Divine institutions. ", "They were, doubtless, good men, just and sage. ", "But, out of the whole human family, it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman's heart, and disentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. ", "She seemed conscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude; ", "for, as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony, the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled. ", "The voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous John Wilson, the eldest clergyman of Boston, a great scholar, like most of his contemporaries in the profession, and withal a man of kind and genial spirit. ", "This last attribute, however, had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts, and was, in truth, rather a matter of shame than self-congratulation with him. ", "There he stood, with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap; ", "while his gray eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking, like those of Hester's infant, in the unadulterated sunshine. ", "He looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons; ", "and had no more right than one of those portraits would have, to step forth, as he now did, and meddle with a question of human guilt, passion, and anguish. \" ", "Hester Prynne,\" said the clergyman, \"I have striven with my young brother here, under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sit,\"-here Mr. Wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside him,-\"I have sought, I say, to persuade this godly youth, that he should deal with you, here in the face of Heaven, and before these wise and upright rulers, and in hearing of all the people, as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin. ", "Knowing your natural temper better than I, he could the better judge what arguments to use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy; ", "insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall. ", "But he opposes to me (with a young man's over-softness, albeit wise beyond his years), that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secrets in such broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude. ", "Truly, as I sought to convince him, the shame lay in the commission of the sin, and not in the showing of it forth. ", "What say you to it, once again, Brother Dimmesdale? ", "Must it be thou, or I, that shall deal with this poor sinner's soul? ", "\" There was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony; ", "and Governor Bellingham gave expression to its purport, speaking in an authoritative voice, although tempered with respect towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed. \" ", "Good Master Dimmesdale,\" said he, \"the responsibility of this woman's soul lies greatly with you. ", "It behooves you, therefore, to exhort her to repentance, and to confession, as a proof and consequence thereof. ", "The directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale; ", "a young clergyman, who had come from one of the great English universities, bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest-land. ", "His eloquence and religious fervor had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession. ", "He was a person of very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and impending brow, large brown, melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless when he forcibly compressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self-restraint. ", "Notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholar-like attainments, there was an air about this young minister,-an apprehensive, a startled, a half-frightened look,-as of a being who felt himself quite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence, and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own. ", "Therefore, so far as his duties would permit, he trod in the shadowy by-paths, and thus kept himself simple and childlike; ", "coming forth, when occasion was, with a freshness, and fragrance, and dewy purity of thought, which, as many people said, affected them like the speech of an angel. ", "Such was the young man whom the Reverend Mr. Wilson and the Governor had introduced so openly to the public notice, bidding him speak, in the hearing of all men, to that mystery of a woman's soul, so sacred even in its pollution. ", "The trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek, and made his lips tremulous. ", "\"Speak to the woman, my brother,\" said Mr. Wilson. ", "\" It is of moment to her soul, and therefore, as the worshipful Governor says, momentous to thine own, in whose charge hers is. ", "Exhort her to confess the truth!\" ", "The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale bent his head, in silent prayer, as it seemed, and then came forward. \" ", "Hester Prynne,\" said he, leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes, \"thou hearest what this good man says, and seest the accountability under which I labor. ", "If thou feelest it to be for thy soul's peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer! ", "Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; ", "for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee, on thy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life. ", "What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt him-yea, compel him, as it were-to add hypocrisy to sin? ", "Heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee, and the sorrow without. ", "Take heed how thou deniest to him-who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself-the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!\" ", "The young pastor's voice was tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and broken. ", "The feeling that it so evidently manifested, rather than the direct purport of the words, caused it to vibrate within all hearts, and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy. ", "Even the poor baby, at Hester's bosom, was affected by the same influence; ", "for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards Mr. Dimmesdale, and held up its little arms, with a half-pleased, half-plaintive murmur. ", "So powerful seemed the minister's appeal, that the people could not believe but that Hester Prynne would speak out the guilty name; ", "or else that the guilty one himself, in whatever high or lowly place he stood, would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity, and compelled to ascend to the scaffold. ", "Hester shook her head. ", "Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven's mercy!\" cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, more harshly than before. ", "\" That little babe hath been gifted with a voice, to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard. ", "Speak out the name! ", "That, and thy repentance, may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy breast.\" ", "\"Never!\" replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. ", "\" It is too deeply branded. ", "Ye cannot take it off. ", "And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine!\" ", "\"Speak, woman!\" said another voice, coldly and sternly, proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold. ", "\" Speak; ", "and give your child a father!\" ", "\"I will not speak!\" answered Hester, turning pale as death, but responding to this voice, which she too surely recognized. ", "\" And my child must seek a heavenly Father; ", "she shall never know an earthly one!\" ", "\"She will not speak!\" murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who, leaning over the balcony, with his hand upon his heart, had awaited the result of his appeal. ", "He now drew back, with a long respiration. ", "\" Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman's heart! ", "She will not speak!\" ", "[Illustration: ", "She was led back to Prison\"] ", " Discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit's mind, the elder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion, addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches, but with continual reference to the ignominious letter. ", "So forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the people's heads, that it assumed new terrors in their imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit. ", "Hester Prynne, meanwhile, kept her place upon the pedestal of shame, with glazed eyes, and an air of weary indifference. ", "She had borne, that morning, all that nature could endure; ", "and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility, while the faculties of animal life remained entire. ", "In this state, the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears. ", "The infant, during the latter portion of her ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and screams; ", "she strove to hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to sympathize with its trouble. ", "With the same hard demeanor, she was led back to prison, and vanished from the public gaze within its iron-clamped portal. ", "It was whispered, by those who peered after her, that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way of the interior. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              IV. ", "THE INTERVIEW. ", "After her return to the prison, Hester Prynne was found to be in a state of nervous excitement that demanded constant watchfulness, lest she should perpetrate violence on herself, or do some half-frenzied mischief to the poor babe. ", "As night approached, it proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment, Master Brackett, the jailer, thought fit to introduce a physician. ", "He described him as a man of skill in all Christian modes of physical science, and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could teach, in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest. ", "To say the truth, there was much need of professional assistance, not merely for Hester herself, but still more urgently for the child; ", "who, drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded the mother's system. ", "It now writhed in convulsions of pain, and was a forcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony which Hester Prynne had borne throughout the day. ", "Closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that individual, of singular aspect, whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter. ", "He was lodged in the prison, not as suspected of any offence, but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him, until the magistrates should have conferred with the Indian sagamores respecting his ransom. ", "His name was announced as Roger Chillingworth. ", "The jailer, after ushering him into the room, remained a moment, marvelling at the comparative quiet that followed his entrance; ", "for Hester Prynne had immediately become as still as death, although the child continued to moan. ", "\"Prithee, friend, leave me alone with my patient,\" said the practitioner. ", "Trust me, good jailer, you shall briefly have peace in your house; ", "and, I promise you, Mistress Prynne shall hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore.\" ", "\"Nay, if your worship can accomplish that,\" answered Master Brackett, \"I shall own you for a man of skill indeed! ", "Verily, the woman hath been like a possessed one; ", "and there lacks little, that I should take in hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes. ", "\" The stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging. ", "Nor did his demeanor change, when the withdrawal of the prison-keeper left him face to face with the woman, whose absorbed notice of him, in the crowd, had intimated so close a relation between himself and her. ", "His first care was given to the child; ", "whose cries, indeed, as she lay writhing on the trundle-bed, made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her. ", "He examined the infant carefully, and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case, which he took from beneath his dress. ", "It appeared to contain medical preparations, one of which he mingled with a cup of water. ", "\"My old studies in alchemy,\" observed he, \"and my sojourn, for above a year past, among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples, have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree. ", "Here, woman! ", "The child is yours,-she is none of mine,-neither will she recognize my voice or aspect as a father's. ", "Administer this draught, therefore, with thine own hand. ", "Hester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazing with strongly marked apprehension into his face. \" ", "Wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe?\" whispered she. ", "\"Foolish woman!\" responded the physician, half coldly, half soothingly. ", "\" What should ail me, to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe? ", "The medicine is potent for good; ", "and were it my child,-yea, mine own, as well as thine!-I could do no better for it. ", "\" As she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state of mind, he took the infant in his arms, and himself administered the draught. ", "It soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed the leech's pledge. ", "The moans of the little patient subsided; ", "its convulsive tossings gradually ceased; ", "and, in a few moments, as is the custom of young children after relief from pain, it sank into a profound and dewy slumber. ", "The physician, as he had a fair right to be termed, next bestowed his attention on the mother. ", "With calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse, looked into her eyes,-a gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder, because so familiar, and yet so strange and cold,-and, finally, satisfied with his investigation, proceeded to mingle another draught. ", "\"I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,\" remarked he; ", "but I have learned many new secrets in the wilderness, and here is one of them,-a recipe that an Indian taught me, in requital of some lessons of my own, that were as old as Paracelsus. ", "Drink it! ", "It may be less soothing than a sinless conscience. ", "That I cannot give thee. ", "But it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion, like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea.\" ", "He presented the cup to Hester, who received it with a slow, earnest look into his face; ", "not precisely a look of fear, yet full of doubt and questioning, as to what his purposes might be. ", "She looked also at her slumbering child. ", "\"I have thought of death,\" said she,-\"have wished for it,-would even have prayed for it, were it fit that such as I should pray for anything. ", "Yet if death be in this cup, I bid thee think again, ere thou beholdest me quaff it. ", "See! ", "It is even now at my lips.\" ", "\"Drink, then,\" replied he, still with the same cold composure. ", "\" Dost thou know me so little, Hester Prynne? ", "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow? ", "Even if I imagine a scheme of vengeance, what could I do better for my object than to let thee live,-than to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of life,-so that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom? ", "\" As he spoke, he laid his long forefinger on the scarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch into Hester's breast, as if it had been red-hot.

", "Her prison-door was thrown open, and she came forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. ", "Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger. ", "Then, she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph. ", "It was, moreover, a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. ", "The very law that condemned her-a giant of stern features, but with vigor to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm-had held her up, through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy. ", "But now, with this unattended walk from her prison-door, began the daily custom; ", "and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it. ", "She could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief. ", "To-morrow would bring its own trial with it; ", "so would the next day, and so would the next; ", "each its own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne. ", "The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling down; ", "for the accumulating days, and added years, would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame. ", "Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful passion. ", "Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast,-at her, the child of honorable parents,-at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be a woman,-at her, who had once been innocent,-as the figure, the body, the reality of sin. ", "And over her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument. ", "It may seem marvellous, that, with the world before her,-kept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the Puritan settlement, so remote and so obscure,-free to return to her birthplace, or to any other European land, and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior, as completely as if emerging into another state of being,-and having also the passes of the dark, inscrutable forest open to her, where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned her,-it may seem marvellous, that this woman should still call that place her home, where, and where only, she must needs be the type of shame. ", "But there is a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and marked event has given the color to their lifetime; ", "and still the more irresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. ", "Her sin, her ignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil. ", "It was as if a new birth, with stronger assimilations than the first, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne's wild and dreary, but life-long home. ", "All other scenes of earth-even that village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother's keeping, like garments put off long ago-were foreign to her, in comparison. ", "The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken. ", "It might be, too,-doubtless it was so, although she hid the secret from herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart, like a serpent from its hole,-it might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal. ", "There dwelt, there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognized on earth, would bring them together before the bar of final judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a joint futurity of endless retribution. ", "Over and over again, the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon Hester's contemplation, and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized, and then strove to cast it from her. ", "She barely looked the idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon. ", "What she compelled herself to believe-what, finally, she reasoned upon, as her motive for continuing a resident of New England-was half a truth, and half a self-delusion. ", "Here, she said to herself, had been the scene of her guilt, and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment; ", "and so, perchance, the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul, and work out another purity than that which she had lost; ", "more saint-like, because the result of martyrdom. ", "[Illustration: ", "The Lonesome Dwelling]  Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. ", "On the outskirts of the town, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. ", "It had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants. ", "It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. ", "A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. ", "In this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with her infant child. ", "A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot. ", "Children, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities, would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the doorway, or laboring in her little garden, or coming forth along the pathway that led townward; ", "and, discerning the scarlet letter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagious fear. ", "Lonely as was Hester's situation, and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk of want. ", "She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her thriving infant and herself. ", "It was the art-then, as now, almost the only one within a woman's grasp-of needlework. ", "She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroidered letter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill, of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold. ", "Here, indeed, in the sable simplicity that generally characterized the Puritanic modes of dress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork. ", "Yet the taste of the age, demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with. ", "Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people, were, as a matter of policy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. ", "Deep ruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power; ", "and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. ", "In the array of funerals, too,-whether for the apparel of the dead body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,-there was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labor as Hester Prynne could supply. ", "Baby-linen-for babies then wore robes of state-afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument. ", "By degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion. ", "Whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny; ", "or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things; ", "or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow, on some persons, what others might seek in vain; ", "or because Hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant ", "it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle. ", "Vanity, it may be, chose to mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state, the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. ", "Her needlework was seen on the ruff of the Governor; ", "military men wore it on their scarfs, and the minister on his band; ", "it decked the baby's little cap; ", "it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the coffins of the dead. ", "But it is not recorded that, in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride. ", "The exception indicated the ever-relentless rigor with which society frowned upon her sin. ", "Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple abundance for her child. ", "Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue; ", "with only that one ornament,-the scarlet letter,-which it was her doom to wear. ", "The child's attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning. ", "We may speak further of it hereafter. ", "Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them. ", "Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor. ", "It is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork. ", "She had in her nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,-a taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise itself upon. ", "Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. ", "To Hester Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and therefore soothing, the passion of her life. ", "Like all other joys, she rejected it as sin. ", "This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine and steadfast penitence, but something doubtful, something that might be deeply wrong, beneath. ", "In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world. ", "With her native energy of character, and rare capacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman's heart than that which branded the brow of Cain. ", "In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it. ", "Every gesture, every word, and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact, implied, and often expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind. ", "She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make itself seen or felt; ", "no more smile with the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred sorrow; ", "or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible repugnance. ", "These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart. ", "It was not an age of delicacy; ", "and her position, although she understood it well, and was in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot. ", "The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succor them. ", "Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; ", "sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles; ", "and sometimes, also, by a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer's defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. ", "Hester had schooled herself long and well; ", "she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. ", "She was patient,-a martyr, indeed,-but she forbore to pray for her enemies; ", "lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse. ", "Continually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying, the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal. ", "Clergymen paused in the street to address words of exhortation, that brought a crowd, with its mingled grin and frown, around the poor, sinful woman. ", "If she entered a church, trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the Universal Father, it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse. ", "She grew to have a dread of children; ", "for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, with never any companion but one only child. ", "Therefore, first allowing her to pass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries, and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously. ", "It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knew of it; ", "it could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,-had the summer breeze murmured about it,-had the wintry blast shrieked it aloud! ", "Another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye. ", "When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter,-and none ever failed to do so,-they branded it afresh into Hester's soul; ", "so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain, yet always did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand. ", "But then, again, an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict. ", "Its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable. ", "From first to last, in short, Hester Prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token; ", "the spot never grew callous; ", "it seemed, on the contrary, to grow more sensitive with daily torture. ", "[Illustration: ", "Lonely Footsteps]   ", "But sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in many months, she felt an eye-a human eye-upon the ignominious brand, that seemed to give a momentary relief, as if half of her agony were shared. ", "The next instant, back it all rushed again, with still a deeper throb of pain; ", "for, in that brief interval, she had sinned anew. ", "Had Hester sinned alone? ", "Her imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would have been still more so, by the strange and solitary anguish of her life. ", "Walking to and fro, with those lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was outwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Hester,-if altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted,-she felt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense. ", "She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. ", "She was terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus made. ", "What were they? ", "Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman, as yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of purity was but a lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne's? ", "Or, must she receive those intimations-so obscure, yet so distinct-as truth? ", "In all her miserable experience, there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense. ", "It perplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action. ", "Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels. ", "\" What evil thing is at hand?\" would Hester say to herself. ", "Lifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human within the scope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! ", "Again, a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as she met the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according to the rumor of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life. ", "That unsunned snow in the matron's bosom, and the burning shame on Hester Prynne's,-what had the two in common? ", "Or, once more, the electric thrill would give her warning,-\"Behold, Hester, here is a companion!\"-and, looking up, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly averted with a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; ", "as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance. ", "O Fiend, whose talisman was that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in youth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?-such loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin. ", "Be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and man's hard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself. ", "The vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend. ", "They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. ", "And we must needs say, it seared Hester's bosom so deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              VI. ", "PEARL. ", "[Illustration]   ", "We have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; ", "that little creature, whose innocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable decree of Providence, a lovely and immortal flower, out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion. ", "How strange it seemed to the sad woman, as she watched the growth, and the beauty that became every day more brilliant, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child! ", "Her Pearl!-For so had Hester called her; ", "not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing of the calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison. ", "But she named the infant \"Pearl,\" as being of great price,-purchased with all she had,-her mother's only treasure! ", "How strange, indeed! ", "Man had marked this woman's sin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it were sinful like herself. ", "God, as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonored bosom, to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven! ", "Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension. ", "She knew that her deed had been evil; ", "she could have no faith, therefore, that its result would be good. ", "Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child's expanding nature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being. ", "Certainly, there was no physical defect. ", "By its perfect shape, its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden; ", "worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels, after the world's first parents were driven out. ", "The child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; ", "its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. ", "But little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. ", "Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye. ", "So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor of Pearl's own proper beauty, shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her, on the darksome cottage floor. ", "And yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child's rude play, made a picture of her just as perfect. ", "Pearl's aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; ", "in this one child there were many children, comprehending the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess. ", "Throughout all, however, there was a trait of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never lost; ", "and if, in any of her changes, she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself,-it would have been no longer Pearl! ", "This outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly express, the various properties of her inner life. ", "Her nature appeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; ", "but-or else Hester's fears deceived her-it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born. ", "The child could not be made amenable to rules. ", "In giving her existence, a great law had been broken; ", "and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; ", "or ", "with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered. ", "Hester could only account for the child's character-and even then most vaguely and imperfectly-by recalling what she herself had been, during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of earth. ", "The mother's impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life; ", "and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of the intervening substance. ", "Above all, the warfare of Hester's spirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Pearl. ", "She could recognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart. ", "They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition, but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind. ", "The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more rigid kind than now. ", "The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues. ", "Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity. ", "Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge. ", "But the task was beyond her skill. ", "After testing both smiles and frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside, and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. ", "Physical compulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. ", "As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little Pearl might or might not be within its reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. ", "Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be labor thrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. ", "It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Hester could not help questioning, at such moments, whether Pearl were a human child. ", "She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. ", "Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility; ", "it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering light, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. ", "Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards the child,-to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began,-to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure and ", "earnest kisses,-not so much from overflowing love, as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterly delusive. ", "But Pearl's laugh, when she was caught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before. ", "Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so often came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had bought so dear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimes burst into passionate tears. ", "Then, perhaps,-for there was no foreseeing how it might affect her,-Pearl would frown, and clench her little fist, and harden her small features into a stern, unsympathizing look of discontent. ", "Not seldom, she would laugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow. ", "Or-but this more rarely happened-she would be convulsed with a rage of grief, and sob out her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intent on proving that she had a heart, by breaking it. ", "Yet Hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness; ", "it passed, as suddenly as it came. ", "Brooding over all these matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. ", "Her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep. ", "Then she was sure of her, and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; ", "until-perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lids-little Pearl awoke! ", "How soon-with what strange rapidity, indeed!-did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother's ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! ", "And then what a happiness would it have been, could Hester Prynne have heard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children! ", "But this could never be. ", "Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world. ", "An imp of evil, emblem and product of sin, she had no right among christened infants. ", "Nothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which the child comprehended her loneliness; ", "the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her; ", "the whole peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other children. ", "Never, since her release from prison, had Hester met the public gaze without her. ", "In all her walks about the town, Pearl, too, was there; ", "first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Hester's. ", "She saw the children of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the Puritanic nurture would permit; ", "playing at going to church, perchance; ", "or at scourging Quakers; ", "or ", "taking scalps in a sham-fight with the Indians; ", "or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft. ", "Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance. ", "If spoken to, she would not speak again. ", "If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because they had so much the sound of a witch's anathemas in some unknown tongue. ", "The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and child; ", "and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. ", "Pearl felt the sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. ", "These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her mother; ", "because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child's manifestations. ", "It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself. ", "All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited, by inalienable right, out of Hester's heart. ", "Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society; ", "and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before Pearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity. ", "At home, within and around her mother's cottage, Pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. ", "The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. ", "The unlikeliest materials-a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower-were the puppets of Pearl's witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world. ", "Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. ", "The pine-trees, aged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; ", "the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully. ", "It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity,-soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life,-and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. ", "It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. ", "In the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties; ", "except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. ", "The singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind. ", "She never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon's teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom she rushed to battle. ", "It was inexpressibly sad-then what depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the cause!-to observe, in one so young, this constant recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue. ", "Gazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon her knees, and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden, but which made utterance for itself, betwixt speech and a groan,-\"O Father in Heaven,-if ", "Thou art still my Father,-what is this being which I have brought into the world!\" ", "And Pearl, overhearing the ejaculation, or aware, through some more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile with sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play. ", "[Illustration: ", "A touch of Pearl's baby-hand]   ", "One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be told. ", "The very first thing which she had noticed in her life was-what?-not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. ", "By no means! ", "But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was-shall we say it?-the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! ", "One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; ", "and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child. ", "Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavoring to tear it away; ", "so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl's baby-hand. ", "Again, as if her mother's agonized gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile! ", "From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment's safety; ", "not a moment's calm enjoyment of her. ", "Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; ", "but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes. ", "Once, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's eyes, while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; ", "and, suddenly,-for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,-she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face, in the small black mirror of Pearl's eye. ", "It was a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. ", "It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. ", "Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion. ", "In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after Pearl grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; ", "dancing up and down, like a little elf, whenever she hit the scarlet letter. ", "Hester's first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. ", "But, whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl's wild eyes. ", "Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to seek it in another. ", "At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughing image of a fiend peeping out-or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it-from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes. ", "\"Child, what art thou?\" cried the mother. ", "\"O, I am your little Pearl!\" answered the child. ", "But, while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down, with the humorsome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney. ", "Art thou my child, in very truth?\" asked Hester. ", "Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; ", "for, such was Pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself. ", "Yes; ", "I am little Pearl!\" repeated the child, continuing her antics. ", "Thou art not my child! ", "Thou art no Pearl of mine!\" said the mother, half playfully; ", "for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her, in the midst of her deepest suffering. \" ", "Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither.\" ", "\"Tell me, mother!\" said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and pressing herself close to her knees. ", "\" Do thou tell me!\" ", "\"Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!\" answered Hester Prynne. ", "But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. ", "Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger, and touched the scarlet letter. ", "\"He did not send me!\" cried she, positively. ", "\" I have no Heavenly Father!\" ", "\"Hush, Pearl, hush! ", "Thou must not talk so!\" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. ", "He sent us all into this world. ", "He sent even me, thy mother. ", "Then, much more, thee! ", "Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?\" ", "\"Tell me! ", "Tell me!\" repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing, and capering about the floor. ", "\" It is thou that must tell me!\" ", "But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. ", "She remembered-betwixt a smile and a shudder-the talk of the neighboring towns-people; ", "who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring; ", "such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their mother's sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose. ", "Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; ", "nor was Pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the New England Puritans. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                             VII. ", "THE GOVERNOR'S HALL. ", "[Illustration]  Hester Prynne went, one day, to the mansion of Governor Bellingham, with a pair of gloves, which she had fringed and embroidered to his order, and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state; ", "for, though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank, he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy. ", "Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled Hester, at this time, to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement. ", "It had reached her ears, that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government, to deprive her of her child. ", "On the supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother's soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from her path. ", "If the child, on the other hand, were really capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than Hester Prynne's. ", "Among those who promoted the design, Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy. ", "It may appear singular, and indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took sides. ", "At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight, than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. ", "The period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature. ", "Full of concern, therefore,-but so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public, on the one side, and a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies of nature, on the other,-Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary cottage. ", "Little Pearl, of course, was her companion. ", "She was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother's side, and, constantly in motion, from morn till sunset, could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her. ", "Often, nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded to be taken up in arms; ", "but was soon as imperious to be set down again, and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway, with many a harmless trip and tumble. ", "We have spoken of Pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty; ", "a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints; ", "a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. ", "There was fire in her and throughout her; ", "she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. ", "Her mother, in contriving the child's garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play; ", "arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes of gold-thread. ", "So much strength of coloring, which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl's beauty, and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth. ", "But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed, of the child's whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom. ", "It was the scarlet letter in another form; ", "the scarlet letter endowed with life! ", "The mother herself-as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form-had carefully wrought out the similitude; ", "lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. ", "But, in truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; ", "and only in consequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance. ", "As the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the children of the Puritans looked up from their play,-or what passed for play with those sombre little urchins,-and spake gravely one to another: ", "-  \"Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; ", "and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side! ", "Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!\" ", "But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put them all to flight. ", "She resembled, in her fierce pursuit of them, an infant pestilence,-the scarlet fever, or some such half-fledged angel of judgment,-whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation. ", "She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them. ", "The victory accomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her mother, and looked up, smiling, into her face. ", "Without further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor Bellingham. ", "This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns; ", "now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences, remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passed away, within their dusky chambers. ", "Then, however, there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human habitation, into which death had never entered. ", "It had, indeed, a very cheery aspect; ", "the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed; ", "so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful. ", "The brilliancy might have befitted Aladdin's palace, rather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler. ", "It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the admiration of after times. ", "Pearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caper and dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her to play with. \" ", "No, my little Pearl!\" said her mother. ", "\" Thou must gather thine own sunshine. ", "I have none to give thee! ", "\" They approached the door; ", "which was of an arched form, and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with wooden shutters to close over them at need. ", "Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor's bond-servants; ", "a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years' slave. ", "During that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. ", "The serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men of that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England. \" ", "Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?\" inquired Hester. ", "Yea, forsooth,\" replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen. ", "\" Yea, his honorable worship is within. ", "But he hath a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. ", "Ye may not see his worship now.\" ", "\"Nevertheless, I will enter,\" answered Hester Prynne, and the bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land, offered no opposition. ", "So the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance. ", "With many variations, suggested by the nature of his building-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. ", "Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the whole depth of the house, and forming a medium of general communication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments. ", "At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small recess on either side of the portal. ", "At the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in old books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat. ", "Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles of England, or other such substantial literature; ", "even as, in our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be turned over by the casual guest. ", "The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; ", "and likewise a table in the same taste; ", "the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor's paternal home. ", "On the table-in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind-stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale. ", "On the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of the Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their breasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace. ", "All were characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on; ", "as if they were the ghosts, rather than the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men. ", "[Illustration: ", "The Governor's Breastplate]   ", "At about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall, was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic, but of the most modern date; ", "for it had been manufactured by a skilful armorer in London, the same year in which Governor Bellingham came over to New England. ", "There was a steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; ", "all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor. ", "This bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war. ", "For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, and Finch as his professional associates, the exigencies of this new country had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a statesman and ruler. ", "Little Pearl-who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house-spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate. \" ", "Mother,\" cried she, \"I see you here. ", "Look! ", "Look!\" ", "Hester looked, by way of humoring the child; ", "and she saw that, owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions, so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance. ", "In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it. ", "Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar picture in the head-piece; ", "smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy. ", "That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child, but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl's shape. \" ", "Come along, Pearl,\" said she, drawing her away. ", "Come and look into this fair garden. ", "It may be we shall see flowers there; ", "more beautiful ones than we find in the woods. ", "\" Pearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther end of the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted with closely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery. ", "But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening. ", "Cabbages grew in plain sight; ", "and a pumpkin-vine, rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall-window; ", "as if to warn the Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth would offer him. ", "There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula; ", "that half-mythological personage, who rides through our early annals, seated on the back of a bull. ", "Pearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would not be pacified. \" ", "Hush, child, hush!\" said her mother, earnestly. ", "\" Do not cry, dear little Pearl! ", "I hear voices in the garden. ", "The Governor is coming, and gentlemen along with him!\" ", "In fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house. ", "Pearl, in utter scorn of her mother's attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch scream, and then became silent; ", "not from any notion of obedience, but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of these new personages. ", "[Illustration]                             VIII. ", "THE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER. ", "Governor Bellingham, in a loose gown and easy cap,-such as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with, in their domestic privacy,-walked foremost, and appeared to be showing off his estate, and expatiating on his projected improvements. ", "The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff, beneath his gray beard, in the antiquated fashion of King James's reign, caused his head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist in a charger. ", "The impression made by his aspect, so rigid and severe, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age, was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself. ", "But it is an error to suppose that our grave forefathers-though accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare, and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of duty-made it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort, or even luxury, as lay fairly within their grasp. ", "This creed was never taught, for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose beard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham's shoulder; ", "while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, against the sunny garden-wall. ", "The old clergyman, nurtured at the rich bosom of the English Church, had a long-established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things; ", "and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit, or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne, still the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries. ", "Behind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests: ", "one the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne's disgrace; ", "and, in close companionship with him, old Roger Chillingworth, a person of great skill in physic, who, for two or three years past, had been settled in the town. ", "It was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister, whose health had severely suffered, of late, by his too unreserved self-sacrifice to the labors and duties of the pastoral relation. ", "The Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two steps, and, throwing open the leaves of the great hall-window, found himself close to little Pearl. ", "The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne, and partially concealed her. ", "\"What have we here?\" said Governor Bellingham, looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him. ", "\" I profess, I have never seen the like, since my days of vanity, in old King James's time, when I was wont to esteem it a high favor to be admitted to a court mask! ", "There used to be a swarm of these small apparitions, in holiday time; ", "and we called them children of the Lord of Misrule. ", "But how gat such a guest into my hall?\" ", "\"Ay, indeed!\" cried good old Mr. Wilson. ", "\" What little bird of scarlet plumage may this be? ", "Methinks I have seen just such figures, when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window, and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor. ", "But that was in the old land. ", "Prithee, young one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion? ", "Art thou a Christian child,-ha? ", "Dost know thy catechism? ", "Or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies, whom we thought to have left behind us, with other relics of Papistry, in merry old England?\" ", "\"I am mother's child,\" answered the scarlet vision, \"and my name is Pearl!\" ", "\"Pearl?-Ruby, rather!-or Coral!-or Red Rose, at the very least, judging from thy hue!\" responded the old minister, putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl on the cheek. ", "\" But where is this mother of thine? ", "Ah! ", "I see,\" he added; ", "and, turning to Governor Bellingham, whispered, \"This is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together; ", "and ", "behold here the unhappy woman, Hester Prynne, her mother!\" ", "\"Sayest thou so?\" cried the Governor. ", "\" Nay, we might have judged that such a child's mother must needs be a scarlet woman, and a worthy type of her of Babylon! ", "But she comes at a good time; ", "and we will look into this matter forthwith.\" ", "Governor Bellingham stepped through the window into the hall, followed by his three guests. \" ", "Hester Prynne,\" said he, fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter, \"there hath been much question concerning thee, of late. ", "The point hath been weightily discussed, whether we, that are of authority and influence, do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul, such as there is in yonder child, to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen, amid the pitfalls of this world. ", "Speak thou, the child's own mother! ", "Were it not, thinkest thou, for thy little one's temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth? ", "What canst thou do for the child, in this kind?\" ", "\"I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!\" answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token. ", "\"Woman, it is thy badge of shame!\" replied the stern magistrate. ", "\" It is because of the stain which that letter indicates, that we would transfer thy child to other hands.\" ", "\"Nevertheless,\" said the mother, calmly, though growing more pale, \"this badge hath taught me-it daily teaches me-it is teaching me at this moment-lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better, albeit they can profit nothing to myself.\" ", "\"We will judge warily,\" said Bellingham, \"and look well what we are about to do. ", "Good Master Wilson, I pray you, examine this Pearl,-since that is ", "her name,-and ", "see whether she hath had such Christian nurture as befits a child of her age. ", "\" The old minister seated himself in an arm-chair, and made an effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees. ", "But the child, unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother, escaped through the open window, and stood on the upper step, looking like a wild tropical bird, of rich plumage, ready to take flight into the upper air. ", "Mr. Wilson, not a little astonished at this outbreak,-for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage, and usually a vast favorite with children,-essayed, however, to proceed with the examination. ", "\"Pearl,\" said he, with great solemnity, \"thou must take heed to instruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price. ", "Canst thou tell me, my child, who made thee?\" ", "Now Pearl knew well enough who made her; ", "for Hester Prynne, the daughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk with the child about her Heavenly Father, had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit, at whatever stage of immaturity, imbibes with such eager interest. ", "Pearl, therefore, so large were the attainments of her three years' lifetime, could have borne a fair examination in the New England Primer, or the first column of the Westminster Catechisms, although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works. ", "But that perversity which all children have more or less of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now, at the most inopportune moment, took thorough possession of her, and closed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss. ", "After putting her finger in her mouth, with many ungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson's question, the child finally announced that she had not been made at all, but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door. ", "This fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the Governor's red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window; ", "together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in coming hither. ", "Old Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whispered something in the young clergyman's ear. ", "Hester Prynne looked at the man of skill, and even then, with her fate hanging in the balance, was startled to perceive what a change had come over his features,-how much uglier they ", "were,-how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier, and his figure more misshapen,-since the days when she had familiarly known him. ", "She met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward. ", "\"This is awful!\" cried the Governor, slowly recovering from the astonishment into which Pearl's response had thrown him. ", "\" Here is a child of three years old, and she cannot tell who made her! ", "Without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny! ", "Methinks, gentlemen, we need inquire no further.\" ", "Hester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly into her arms, confronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression. ", "Alone in the world, cast off by it, and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive, she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world, and was ready to defend them to the death. \" ", "God gave me the child!\" cried she. \" ", "He gave her in requital of all things else, which ye had taken from me. ", "She is my happiness!-she is my torture, none the less! ", "Pearl keeps me here in life! ", "Pearl punishes me too! ", "See ye not, she is the scarlet letter, only capable of being loved, and so endowed with a million-fold the power of retribution for my sin? ", "Ye shall not take her! ", "I will die first!\" ", "[Illustration: ", "Look thou to it! ", "I will not lose the child!\"] \"My poor woman,\" said the not unkind old minister, \"the child shall be well cared for!-far better than thou canst do it!\" ", "\"God gave her into my keeping,\" repeated Hester Prynne, raising her voice almost to a shriek. ", "\" I will not give her up!\"-And here, by a sudden impulse, she turned to the young clergyman, Mr. Dimmesdale, at whom, up to this moment, she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes.-\"Speak thou for me!\" cried she. ", "Thou wast my pastor, and hadst charge of my soul, and knowest me better than these men can. ", "I will not lose the child! ", "Speak for me! ", "Thou knowest,-for thou hast sympathies which these men lack!-thou knowest what is in my heart, and what are a mother's rights, and how much the stronger they are, when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter! ", "Look thou to it! ", "I will not lose the child! ", "Look to it!\" ", "At this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that Hester Prynne's situation had provoked her to little less than madness, the young minister at once came forward, pale, and holding his hand over his heart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation. ", "He looked now more care-worn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of Hester's public ignominy; ", "and ", "whether it were his failing health, or whatever the cause might be, his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth. ", "\"There is truth in what she says,\" began the minister, with a voice sweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hall re-echoed, and the hollow armor rang with it,-\"truth in what Hester says, and in the feeling which inspires her! ", "God gave her the child, and gave her, too, an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements,-both seemingly so peculiar,-which no other mortal being can possess. ", "And, moreover, is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child?\" \"Ay!-how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?\" interrupted the Governor. \" ", "Make that plain, I pray you!\" ", "\"It must be even so,\" resumed the minister. ", "\" For, if we deem it otherwise, do we not thereby say that the Heavenly Father, the Creator of all flesh, hath lightly recognized a deed of sin, and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love? ", "This child of its father's guilt and its mother's shame hath come from the hand of God, to work in many ways upon her heart, who pleads so earnestly, and with such bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her. ", "It was meant for a blessing; ", "for the one blessing of her life! ", "It was meant, doubtless, as the mother herself hath told us, for a retribution too; ", "a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment; ", "a pang, a sting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled joy! ", "Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom?\" ", "\"Well said, again!\" cried good Mr. Wilson. ", "\" I feared the woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of her child!\" ", "\"O, not so!-not so!\" continued Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "\" She recognizes, believe me, the solemn miracle which God hath wrought, in the existence of that child. ", "And may she feel, too,-what, methinks, is the very truth,-that this boon was meant, above all things else, to keep the mother's soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which Satan might else have sought to plunge her! ", "Therefore it is good for this poor, sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality, a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care,-to be trained up by her to righteousness,-to remind her, at every moment, of her fall,-but yet to teach her, as it were by the Creator's sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child to heaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! ", "Herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father. ", "For Hester Prynne's sake, then, and no less for the poor child's sake, let us leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place them!\" ", "\"You speak, my friend, with a strange earnestness,\" said old Roger Chillingworth, smiling at him. ", "\"And there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken,\" added the Reverend Mr. Wilson. ", "\" What say you, worshipful Master Bellingham? ", "Hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman?\" ", "\"Indeed hath he,\" answered the magistrate, \"and hath adduced such arguments, that we will even leave the matter as it now stands; ", "so long, at least, as there shall be no further scandal in the woman. ", "Care must be had, nevertheless, to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism, at thy hands or Master Dimmesdale's. ", "Moreover, at a proper season, the tithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting. ", "\" The young minister, on ceasing to speak, had withdrawn a few steps from the group, and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the window-curtain; ", "while the shadow of his figure, which the sunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal. ", "Pearl, that wild and flighty little elf, stole softly towards him, and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own, laid her cheek against it; ", "a caress so tender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her mother, who was looking on, asked herself,-\"Is that my Pearl? ", "Yet she knew that there was love in the child's heart, although it mostly revealed itself in passion, and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now. ", "The minister,-for, save the long-sought regards of woman, nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference, accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct, and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be loved,-the minister looked round, laid his hand on the child's head, hesitated an instant, and then kissed her brow. ", "Little Pearl's unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer; ", "she laughed, and went capering down the hall, so airily, that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor. ", "\"The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,\" said he to Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "\" She needs no old woman's broomstick to fly withal!\" ", "\"A strange child!\" remarked old Roger Chillingworth. ", "\" It is easy to see the mother's part in her. ", "Would it be beyond a philosopher's research, think ye, gentlemen, to analyze that child's nature, and, from its make and mould, to give a shrewd guess at the father?\" ", "\"Nay; ", "it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow the clew of profane philosophy,\" said Mr. Wilson. ", "Better to fast and pray upon it; ", "and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery as we find it, unless Providence reveal it of its own accord. ", "Thereby, every good Christian man hath a title to show a father's kindness towards the poor, deserted babe. ", "The affair being so satisfactorily concluded, Hester Prynne, with Pearl, departed from the house. ", "As they descended the steps, it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was thrown open, and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of Mistress Hibbins, Governor Bellingham's bitter-tempered sister, and the same who, a few years later, was executed as a witch. ", "Hist, hist!\" said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house. ", "Wilt thou go with us to-night? ", "There will be a merry company in the forest; ", "and I wellnigh promised the Black Man that comely Hester Prynne should make one.\" ", "\"Make my excuse to him, so please you!\" answered Hester, with a triumphant smile. ", "\" I must tarry at home, and keep watch over my little Pearl. ", "Had they taken her from me, I would willingly have gone with thee into the forest, and signed my name in the Black Man's book too, and that with mine own blood!\" ", "\"We shall have thee there anon!\" said the witch-lady, frowning, as she drew back her head. ", "But here-if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbins and Hester Prynne to be authentic, and not a parable-was already an illustration of the young minister's argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty. ", "Even thus early had the child saved her from Satan's snare. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              IX. ", "THE LEECH. ", "Under the appellation of Roger Chillingworth, the reader will remember, was hidden another name, which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken. ", "It has been related, how, in the crowd that witnessed Hester Prynne's ignominious exposure, stood a man, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous wilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin before the people. ", "Her matronly fame was trodden under all men's feet. ", "Infamy was babbling around her in the public market-place. ", "For her kindred, should the tidings ever reach them, and for the companions of her unspotted life, there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonor; ", "which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. ", "Then why-since the choice was with himself-should the individual, whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable? ", "He resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame. ", "Unknown to all but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and key of her silence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind, and, as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean, whither rumor had long ago consigned him. ", "This purpose once effected, new interests would immediately spring up, and likewise a new purpose; ", "dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties. ", "In pursuance of this resolve, he took up his residence in the Puritan town, as Roger Chillingworth, without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure. ", "As his studies, at a previous period of his life, had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day, it was as a physician that he presented himself, and as such was cordially received. ", "Skilful men, of the medical and chirurgical profession, were of rare occurrence in the colony. ", "They seldom, it would appear, partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. ", "In their researches into the human frame, it may be that the higher and more subtile faculties of such men were materialized, and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself. ", "At all events, the health of the good town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to do with it, had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary, whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favor than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma. ", "The only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor. ", "To such a professional body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. ", "He soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic; ", "in which every remedy contained a multitude of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life. ", "In his Indian captivity, moreover, he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots; ", "nor did he conceal from his patients, that these simple medicines, Nature's boon to the untutored savage, had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the European pharmacop\u0153ia, which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating. ", "This learned stranger was exemplary, as regarded, at least, the outward forms of a religious life, and, early after his arrival, had chosen for his spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "The young divine, whose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford, was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a heaven-ordained apostle, destined, should he live and labor for the ordinary term of life, to do as great deeds for the now feeble New England Church, as the early Fathers had achieved for the infancy of the Christian faith. ", "About this period, however, the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail. ", "By those best acquainted with his habits, the paleness of the young minister's cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study, his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty, and, more than all, by the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice, in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp. ", "Some declared, that, if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it was cause enough, that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet. ", "He himself, on the other hand, with characteristic humility, avowed his belief, that, if Providence should see fit to remove him, it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth. ", "With all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline, there could be no question of the fact. ", "His form grew emaciated; ", "his voice, though still rich and sweet, had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it; ", "he was often observed, on any slight alarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand over his heart, with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of pain. ", "Such was the young clergyman's condition, and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished, all untimely, when Roger Chillingworth made his advent to the town. ", "His first entry on the scene, few people could tell whence, dropping down, as it were, out of the sky, or starting from the nether earth, had an aspect of mystery, which was easily heightened to the miraculous. ", "He was now known to be a man of skill; ", "it was observed that he gathered herbs, and the blossoms of wild-flowers, and dug up roots, and plucked off twigs from the forest-trees, like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes. ", "He was heard to speak of Sir Kenelm Digby, and other famous men,-whose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernatural,-as having been his correspondents or associates. ", "Why, with such rank in the learned world, had he come hither? ", "What could he, whose sphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness? ", "In answer to this query, a rumor gained ground,-and, however absurd, was entertained by some very sensible people,-that Heaven had wrought an absolute miracle, by transporting an eminent Doctor of Physic, from a German university, bodily through the air, and setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale's study! ", "Individuals of wiser faith, indeed, who knew that Heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage-effect of what is called miraculous interposition, were inclined to see a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth's so opportune arrival. ", "This idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman; ", "he attached himself to him as a parishioner, and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility. ", "He expressed great alarm at his pastor's state of health, but was anxious to attempt the cure, and, if early undertaken, seemed not despondent of a favorable result. ", "The elders, the deacons, the motherly dames, and the young and fair maidens, of Mr. Dimmesdale's flock, were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physician's frankly offered skill. ", "Mr. Dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties. ", "\"I need no medicine,\" said he. ", "But how could the young minister say so, when, with every successive Sabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and his voice more tremulous than before,-when it had now become a constant habit, rather than a casual gesture, to press his hand over his heart? ", "Was he weary of his labors? ", "Did he wish to die? ", "These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of his church, who, to use their own phrase, \"dealt with him\" on the sin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out. ", "He listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the physician. \" ", "Were it God's will,\" said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, when, in fulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth's professional advice, \"I could be well content, that my labors, and my sorrows, and my sins, and my pains, should shortly end with me, and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state, rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf.\" ", "\"Ah,\" replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which, whether imposed or natural, marked all his deportment, \"it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak. ", "Youthful men, not having taken a deep root, give up their hold of life so easily! ", "And saintly men, who walk with God on earth, would fain be away, to walk with him on the golden pavements of the New Jerusalem.\" ", "\"Nay,\" rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his heart, with a flush of pain flitting over his brow, \"were I worthier to walk there, I could be better content to toil here.\" ", "\"Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,\" said the physician. ", "[Illustration: ", "The Minister and Leech]   ", "In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "As not only the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient, these two men, so different in age, came gradually to spend much time together. ", "For the sake of the minister's health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; ", "mingling various talk with the plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops. ", "Often, likewise, one was the guest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. ", "There was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science, in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope; ", "together with a range and freedom of ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession. ", "In truth, he was startled, if not shocked, to find this attribute in the physician. ", "Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment largely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time. ", "In no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views; ", "it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron framework. ", "Not the less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse. ", "It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away, amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. ", "But the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. ", "So the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox. ", "Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, both as he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character. ", "He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good. ", "Wherever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these. ", "In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought and imagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there. ", "So Roger Chillingworth-the man of skill, the kind and friendly physician-strove to go deep into his patient's bosom, delving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern. ", "Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has opportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill to follow it up. ", "A man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician. ", "If the latter possess native sagacity, and a nameless something more,-let us call it intuition; ", "if he show no intrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominent characteristics of his own; ", "if he have the power, which must be born with him, to bring his mind into such affinity with his patient's, that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought; ", "if such revelations be received without tumult, and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath, and here and there a word, to indicate that all is understood; ", "if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognized character as a physician;-then, at some inevitable moment, will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow forth in a dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries into the daylight. ", "Roger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes above enumerated. ", "Nevertheless, time went on; ", "a kind of intimacy, as we have said, grew up between these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study, to meet upon; ", "they discussed every topic of ethics and religion, of public affairs and private character; ", "they talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed personal to themselves; ", "and yet no secret, such as the physician fancied must exist there, ever stole out of the minister's consciousness into his companion's ear. ", "The latter had his suspicions, indeed, that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale's bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him. ", "It was a strange reserve! ", "After a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friends of Mr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house; ", "so that every ebb and flow of the minister's life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician. ", "There was much joy throughout the town, when this greatly desirable object was attained. ", "It was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman's welfare; ", "unless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt authorized to do so, he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels, spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife. ", "This latter step, however, there was no present prospect that Arthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; ", "he rejected all suggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church-discipline. ", "Doomed by his own choice, therefore, as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his unsavory morsel always at another's board, and endure the life-long chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at another's fireside, it truly seemed that this sagacious, experienced, benevolent old physician, with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor, was the very man, of all mankind, to be constantly within reach of his voice. ", "The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of King's Chapel has since been built. ", "It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson's home-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, in both minister and man of physic. ", "The motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontide shadow, when desirable. ", "The walls were hung round with tapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events, representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer. ", "Here the pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines, even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yet constrained often to avail themselves. ", "On the other side of the house old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory; ", "not such as a modern man of science ", "would reckon even tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus, and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. ", "With such commodiousness of situation, these two learned persons sat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another's business. ", "And the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale's best discerning friends, as we have intimated, very reasonably imagined that the hand of Providence had done all this, for the purpose-besought in so many public, and domestic, and secret prayers-of restoring the young minister to health. ", "But-it must now be said-another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician. ", "When an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived. ", "When, however, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitions of its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring, as to possess the character of truths supernaturally revealed. ", "The people, in the case of which we speak, could justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation. ", "There was an aged handicraftsman, it is true, who had been a citizen of London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury's murder, now some thirty years agone; ", "he testified to having seen the physician, under some other name, which the narrator of the story had now forgotten, in company with Doctor Forman, the famous old conjurer, who was implicated in the affair of Overbury. ", "Two or three individuals hinted, that the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests; ", "who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art. ", "A large number-and many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable, in other matters-affirmed that Roger Chillingworth's aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town, and especially since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "At first, his expression had been calm, meditative, scholar-like. ", "Now, there was something ugly and evil in his face, which they had not previously noticed, and which grew still the more obvious to sight, the oftener they looked upon him. ", "According to the vulgar idea, the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions, and was fed with infernal fuel; ", "and so, as might be expected, his visage was getting sooty with the smoke. ", "To sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion, that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by Satan himself, or Satan's emissary, in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth. ", "This diabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergyman's intimacy, and plot against his soul. ", "No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which side the victory would turn. ", "The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win. ", "Meanwhile, nevertheless, it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph. ", "Alas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depths of the poor minister's eyes, the battle was a sore one and the victory anything but secure. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              X.                  THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT. ", "Old Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had been calm in temperament, kindly, though not of warm affections, but ever, and in all his relations with the world, a pure and upright man. ", "He had begun an investigation, as he imagined, with the severe and equal integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if the question involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem, instead of human passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. ", "But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity, seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had done all its bidding. ", "He now dug into the poor clergyman's heart, like a miner searching for gold; ", "or, rather, like a sexton delving into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead man's bosom, but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption. ", "Alas for his own soul, if these were what he sought! ", "Sometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician's eyes, burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan's awful doorway in the hillside, and quivered on the pilgrim's face. ", "The soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him. ", "This man,\" said he, at one such moment, to himself, \"pure as they deem him,-all spiritual as he seems,-hath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother. ", "Let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein!\" ", "Then, after long search into the minister's dim interior, and turning over many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural piety, strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by revelation,-all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker,-he would turn back, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another point. ", "He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleep,-or, it may be, broad awake,-with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye. ", "In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor would now and then creak; ", "his garments would rustle; ", "the shadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown across his victim. ", "In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition, would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him. ", "But old Roger Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost intuitive; ", "and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him, there the physician sat; ", "his kind, watchful, sympathizing, but never intrusive friend. ", "Yet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual's character more perfectly, if a certain morbidness, to which, sick hearts are liable, had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind. ", "Trusting no man as his friend, he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared. ", "He therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him, daily receiving the old physician in his study; ", "or ", "visiting the laboratory, and, for recreation's sake, watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency. ", "One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on the sill of the open window, that looked towards the graveyard, he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants. ", "\"Where,\" asked he, with a look askance at them,-for it was the clergyman's peculiarity that he seldom, nowadays, looked straightforth at any object, whether human or inanimate,-\"where, my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?\" ", "\"Even in the graveyard here at hand,\" answered the physician, continuing his employment. ", "\" They are new to me. ", "I found them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, nor other memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds, that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. ", "They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime.\" ", "\"Perchance,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale, \"he earnestly desired it, but could not.\" ", "\"And wherefore?\" rejoined the physician. ", "Wherefore not; ", "since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart, to make manifest an unspoken crime?\" ", "\"That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,\" replied the minister. ", "\"There can be, if I forebode aright, no power, short of the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a human heart. ", "The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed. ", "Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. ", "That, surely, were a shallow view of it. ", "No; ", "these revelations, unless I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. ", "A knowledge of men's hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem. ", "And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.\" ", "\"Then why not reveal them here?\" asked Roger Chillingworth, glancing quietly aside at the minister. ", "\" Why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace?\" ", "\"They mostly do,\" said the clergyman, griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain. ", "\" Many, many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only on the death-bed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation. ", "And ever, after such an outpouring, O, what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful brethren! ", "even as in one who at last draws free air, after long stifling with his own polluted breath. ", "How can it be otherwise? ", "Why should a wretched man, guilty, we will say, of murder, prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at once, and let the universe take care of it!\" ", "\"Yet some men bury their secrets thus,\" observed the calm physician. ", "True; ", "there are such men,\" answered Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "\" But, not to suggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature. ", "Or,-can we not suppose it?-guilty as they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God's glory and man's welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men; ", "because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved by them; ", "no evil of the past be redeemed by better service. ", "So, to their own unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures, looking pure as new-fallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves.\" ", "\"These men deceive themselves,\" said Roger Chillingworth, with somewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slight gesture with his forefinger. ", "\" They fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them. ", "Their love for man, their zeal for God's service,-these holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door, and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them. ", "But, if they seek to glorify God, let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands! ", "If they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement! ", "Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can be better-can be more for God's glory, or man's welfare-than God's own truth? ", "Trust me, such men deceive themselves!\" ", "\"It may be so,\" said the young clergyman, indifferently, as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable. ", "He had a ready faculty, indeed, of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament.-\"But, now, I would ask of my well-skilled physician, whether, in good sooth, he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine?\" ", "Before Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear, wild laughter of a young child's voice, proceeding from the adjacent burial-ground. ", "Looking instinctively from the open window,-for it was summer-time,-the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure. ", "Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact. ", "She now skipped irreverently from one grave to another; ", "until, coming to the broad, flat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy,-perhaps of Isaac Johnson himself,-she began to dance upon it. ", "In reply to her mother's command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously, little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb. ", "Taking a handful of these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered. ", "Hester did not pluck them off. ", "Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window, and smiled grimly down. ", "\"There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for human ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with that child's composition,\" remarked he, as much to himself as to his companion. ", "\" I saw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water, at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane. ", "What, in Heaven's name, is she? ", "Is the imp altogether evil? ", "Hath she affections? ", "Hath she any discoverable principle of being?\" ", "\"None, save the freedom of a broken law,\" answered Mr. Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing the point within himself. ", "\"Whether capable of good, I know not. ", "The child probably overheard their voices; ", "for, looking up to the window, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "The sensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervous dread, from the light missile. ", "Detecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little hands, in the most extravagant ecstasy. ", "Hester Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked up; ", "and all these four persons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted,-\"Come away, mother! ", "Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! ", "He hath got hold of the minister already. ", "Come away, mother, or he will catch you! ", "But he cannot catch little Pearl!\" ", "So she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking fantastically, among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation, nor owned herself akin to it. ", "It was as if she had been made afresh, out of new elements, and must perforce be permitted to live her own life, and be a law unto herself, without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime. ", "\"There goes a woman,\" resumed Roger Chillingworth, after a pause, \"who, be her demerits what they may, hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne. ", "Is Hester Prynne the less miserable, think you, for that scarlet letter on her breast?\" ", "\"I do verily believe it,\" answered the clergyman. ", "\" Nevertheless, I cannot answer for her. ", "There was a look of pain in her face, which I would gladly have been spared the sight of. ", "But still, methinks, it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain, as this poor woman Hester is, than to cover it all up in his heart. ", "\" There was another pause; ", "and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered. ", "\"You inquired of me, a little time agone,\" said he, at length, \"my judgment as touching your health.\" ", "\"I did,\" answered the clergyman, \"and would gladly learn it. ", "Speak frankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.\" ", "\"Freely, then, and plainly,\" said the physician, still busy with his plants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale, \"the disorder is a strange one; ", "not so much in itself, nor as outwardly manifested,-in so far, at least, as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation. ", "Looking daily at you, my good Sir, and watching the tokens of your aspect, now for months gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be, yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you. ", "But-I know not what to say-the disease is what I seem to know, yet know it not.\" ", "\"You speak in riddles, learned Sir,\" said the pale minister, glancing aside out of the window. ", "\"Then, to speak more plainly,\" continued the physician, \"and I crave pardon, Sir,-should it seem to require pardon,-for this needful plainness of my speech. ", "Let me ask,-as your friend,-as one having charge, under Providence, of your life and physical well-being,-hath all the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me?\" ", "\"How can you question it?\" asked the minister. ", "Surely, it were child's play, to call in a physician, and then hide the sore!\" ", "\"You would tell me, then, that I know all?\" said Roger Chillingworth, deliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense and concentrated intelligence, on the minister's face. ", "\" Be it so! ", "But, again! ", "He to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open, knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which he is called upon to cure. ", "A bodily disease, which we look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part. ", "Your pardon, once again, good Sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence. ", "You, Sir, of all men whom I have known, are he whose body is the closest conjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak, with the spirit whereof it is the instrument.\" ", "\"Then I need ask no further,\" said the clergyman, somewhat hastily rising from his chair. ", "\" You deal not, I take it, in medicine for the soul!\" ", "\"Thus, a sickness,\" continued Roger Chillingworth, going on, in an unaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,-but standing up, and confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister, with his low, dark, and misshapen figure,-\"a sickness, a sore place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame. ", "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil? ", "How may this be, unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul?\" \"No!-not to thee!-not to an earthly physician!\" cried Mr. Dimmesdale, passionately, and turning his eyes, full and bright, and with a kind of fierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth. ", "\" Not to thee! ", "But if it be the soul's disease, then do I commit myself to the one Physician of the soul! ", "He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; ", "or he can kill! ", "Let him do with me as, in his justice and wisdom, he shall see good. ", "But who art thou, that meddlest in this matter?-that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his God?\" ", "With a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room. ", "\"It is as well to have made this step,\" said Roger Chillingworth to himself, looking after the minister with a grave smile. ", "\" There is nothing lost. ", "We shall be friends again anon. ", "But see, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself! ", "As with one passion, so with another! ", "He hath done a wild thing erenow, this pious Master Dimmesdale, in the hot passion of his heart!\" ", "[Illustration: ", "The Leech and his Patient]   ", "It proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two companions, on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore. ", "The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had been nothing in the physician's words to excuse or palliate. ", "He marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had expressly sought. ", "With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in making the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to continue the care, which, if not successful in restoring him to health, had, in all probability, been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour. ", "Roger Chillingworth readily assented, and went on with his medical supervision of the minister; ", "doing his best for him, in all good faith, but always quitting the patient's apartment, at the close of a professional interview, with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips. ", "This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale's presence, but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold. ", "\"A rare case!\" ", "he muttered. ", "\" I must needs look deeper into it. ", "A strange sympathy betwixt soul and body! ", "Were it only for the art's sake, I must search this matter to the bottom!\" ", "It came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded, that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirely unawares, fell into a deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair, with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table. ", "It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature. ", "The profound depth of the minister's repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, and as easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. ", "To such an unwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn into itself, that he stirred not in his chair, when old Roger Chillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, came into the room. ", "The physician advanced directly in front of his patient, laid his hand upon his bosom, and thrust aside the vestment, that, hitherto, had always covered it even from the professional eye. ", "Then, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred. ", "After a brief pause, the physician turned away. ", "But, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! ", "With what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features, and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor! ", "Had a man seen old Roger Chillingworth, at that moment of his ecstasy, he would have had no need to ask how Satan comports himself, when a precious human soul is lost to heaven, and won into his kingdom. ", "But what distinguished the physician's ecstasy from Satan's was the trait of wonder in it! ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              XI. ", "THE INTERIOR OF A HEART. ", "After the incident last described, the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician, though externally the same, was really of another character than it had previously been. ", "The intellect of Roger Chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it. ", "It was not, indeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread. ", "Calm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, there was yet, we fear, a quiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this unfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy. ", "To make himself the one trusted friend, to whom should be confided all the fear, the remorse, the agony, the ineffectual repentance, the backward rush of sinful thoughts, expelled in vain! ", "All that guilty sorrow, hidden from the world, whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed to him, the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! ", "All that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance! ", "The clergyman's shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme. ", "Roger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to be hardly, if at all, less satisfied with the aspect of affairs, which Providence-using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, pardoning where it seemed most to punish-had substituted for his black devices. ", "A revelation, he could almost say, had been granted to him. ", "It mattered little, for his object, whether celestial, or from what other region. ", "By its aid, in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale, not merely the external presence, but the very inmost soul, of the latter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that he could see and comprehend its every movement. ", "He became, thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor, in the poor minister's interior world. ", "He could play upon him as he chose. ", "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony? ", "The victim was forever on the rack; ", "it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine;-and the physician knew it well! ", "Would he startle him with sudden fear? ", "As at the waving of a magician's wand, uprose a grisly phantom,-uprose a thousand phantoms,-in many shapes, of death, or more awful shame, all flocking round about the clergyman, and pointing with their fingers at his breast! ", "All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the minister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature. ", "True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully,-even, at times, with horror and the bitterness of hatred,-at the deformed figure of the old physician. ", "His gestures, his gait, his grizzled beard, his slightest and most indifferent acts, the very fashion of his garments, were odious in the clergyman's sight; ", "a token implicitly to be relied on, of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself. ", "For, as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart's entire substance, attributed all his presentiments to no other cause. ", "He took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to Roger Chillingworth, disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them, and did his best to root them out. ", "Unable to accomplish this, he nevertheless, as a matter of principle, continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man, and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to which-poor, forlorn creature that he was, and more wretched than his victim-the avenger had devoted himself. ", "While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul, and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office. ", "He won it, indeed, in great part, by his sorrows. ", "His intellectual gifts, his moral perceptions, his power of experiencing and communicating emotion, were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life. ", "His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminent as several of them were. ", "There were scholars among them, who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore, connected with the divine profession, than Mr. Dimmesdale had lived; ", "and who might well, therefore, be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother. ", "There were men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind than his, and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard, iron, or granite understanding; ", "which, duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient, constitutes a highly respectable, efficacious, and unamiable variety of the clerical species. ", "There were others, again, true saintly fathers, whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books, and by patient thought, and etherealized, moreover, by spiritual communications with the better world, into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages, with their garments of mortality still clinging to them. ", "All that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost, in tongues of flame; ", "symbolizing, it would seem, not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages, but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart's native language. ", "These fathers, otherwise so apostolic, lacked Heaven's last and rarest attestation of their office, the Tongue of Flame. ", "They would have vainly sought-had they ever dreamed of seeking-to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images. ", "Their voices came down, afar and indistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt. ", "[Illustration: ", "The Virgins of the Church]  Not improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr. Dimmesdale, by many of his traits of character, naturally belonged. ", "To the high mountain-peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed, had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden, whatever it might be, of crime or anguish, beneath which it was his doom to totter. ", "It kept him down, on a level with the lowest; ", "him, the man of ethereal attributes, whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered! ", "But this very burden it was, that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind; ", "so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs, and received their pain into itself, and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts, in gushes of sad, persuasive eloquence. ", "Oftenest persuasive, but sometimes terrible! ", "The people knew not the power that moved them thus. ", "They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness. ", "They fancied him the mouthpiece of Heaven's messages of wisdom, and rebuke, and love. ", "In their eyes, the very ground on which he trod was sanctified. ", "The virgins of his church grew pale around him, victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion, and brought it openly, in their white bosoms, as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar. ", "The aged members of his flock, beholding Mr. Dimmesdale's frame so feeble, while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity, believed that he would go heavenward before them, and enjoined it upon their children, that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor's holy grave. ", "And, all this time, perchance, when poor Mr. Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave, he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it, because an accursed thing must there be buried! ", "It is inconceivable, the agony with which this public veneration tortured him! ", "It was his genuine impulse to adore the truth, and to reckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoid of weight or value, that had not its divine essence as the life within their life. ", "Then, what was he?-a substance?-or the dimmest of all shadows? ", "He longed to speak out, from his own pulpit, at the full height of his voice, and tell the people what he was. ", "\" I, whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood,-I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn my pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion, in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,-I, in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,-I, whose footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track, whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest,-I, who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children,-I, who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted,-I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!\" ", "More than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit, with a purpose never to come down its steps, until he should have spoken words like the above. ", "More than once, he had cleared his throat, and drawn in the long, deep, and tremulous breath, which, when sent forth again, would come burdened with the black secret of his soul. ", "More than once-nay, more than a hundred times-he had actually spoken! ", "Spoken! ", "But how? ", "He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile, a viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination, a thing of unimaginable iniquity; ", "and that the only wonder was, that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes, by the burning wrath of the Almighty! ", "Could there be plainer speech than this? ", "Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled? ", "Not so, indeed! ", "They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. ", "They little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning words. ", "\" The godly youth!\" said they among themselves. ", "\" The saint on earth! ", "Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul, what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine!\" ", "The minister well knew-subtle, but remorseful hypocrite that he was!-the light in which his vague confession would be viewed. ", "He had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but had gained only one other sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, without the momentary relief of being self-deceived. ", "He had spoken the very truth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood. ", "And yet, by the constitution of his nature, he loved the truth, and loathed the lie, as few men ever did. ", "Therefore, above all things else, he loathed his miserable self! ", "His inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old, corrupted faith of Rome, than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred. ", "In Mr. Dimmesdale's secret closet, under lock and key, there was a bloody scourge. ", "Oftentimes, this Protestant and Puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders; ", "laughing bitterly at himself the while, and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh. ", "It was his custom, too, as it has been that of many other pious Puritans, to fast,-not, however, like them, in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination, but rigorously, and until his knees trembled beneath him, as an act of penance. ", "He kept vigils, likewise, night after night, sometimes in utter darkness; ", "sometimes with a glimmering lamp; ", "and sometimes, viewing his own face in a looking-glass, by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it. ", "He thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured, but could not purify, himself. ", "In these lengthened vigils, his brain often reeled, and visions seemed to flit before him; ", "perhaps seen doubtfully, and by a faint light of their own, in the remote dimness of the chamber, or more vividly, and close beside him, within the looking-glass. ", "Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes, that grinned and mocked at the pale minister, and beckoned him away with them; ", "now a group of shining angels, who flew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but grew more ethereal as they rose. ", "Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-bearded father, with a saint-like frown, and his mother, turning her face away as she passed by. ", "Ghost of a mother,-thinnest fantasy of a mother,-methinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son! ", "And now, through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly, glided Hester Prynne, leading along little Pearl, in her scarlet garb, and pointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet letter on her bosom, and then at the clergyman's own breast. ", "None of these visions ever quite deluded him. ", "At any moment, by an effort of his will, he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance, and convince himself that they were not solid in their nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big, square, leathern-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity. ", "But, for all that, they were, in one sense, the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with. ", "It is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his, that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us, and which were meant by Heaven to be the spirit's joy and nutriment. ", "To the untrue man, the whole universe is false,-it is impalpable,-it shrinks to nothing within his grasp. ", "And he himself, in so far as he shows himself in a false light, becomes a shadow, or, indeed, ceases to exist. ", "The only truth that continued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth, was the anguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect. ", "Had he once found power to smile, and wear a face of gayety, there would have been no such man! ", "On one of those ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at, but forborne to picture forth, the minister started from his chair. ", "A new thought had struck him. ", "There might be a moment's peace in it. ", "Attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship, and precisely in the same manner, he stole softly down the staircase, undid the door, and issued forth. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                             XII. ", "THE MINISTER'S VIGIL. ", "Walking in the shadow of a dream, as it were, and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism, Mr. Dimmesdale reached the spot where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy. ", "The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house. ", "The minister went up the steps. ", "It was an obscure night of early May. ", "An unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon. ", "If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth, they would have discerned no face above the platform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark gray of the midnight. ", "But the town was all asleep. ", "There was no peril of discovery. ", "The minister might stand there, if it so pleased him, until morning should redden in the east, without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air would creep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism, and clog his throat with catarrh and cough; ", "thereby defrauding the expectant audience of to-morrow's prayer and sermon. ", "No eye could see him, save that ever-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet, wielding the bloody scourge. ", "Why, then, had he come hither? ", "Was it ", "but the mockery of penitence? ", "A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with itself! ", "A mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends rejoiced, with jeering laughter! ", "He had been driven hither by the impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which invariably drew him back, with her tremulous gripe, just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure. ", "Poor, miserable man! ", "what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime? ", "Crime is for the iron-nerved, who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it press too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose, and fling it off at once! ", "This feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither, yet continually did one thing or another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, the agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance. ", "And thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show of expiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast, right over his heart. ", "On that spot, in very truth, there was, and there had long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain. ", "Without any effort of his will, or power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud; ", "an outcry that went pealing through the night, and was beaten back from one house to another, and reverberated from the hills in the background; ", "as if a company of devils, detecting so much misery and terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were bandying it to and fro. ", "\"It is done!\" muttered the minister, covering his face with his hands. ", "\"The whole town will awake, and hurry forth, and find me here!\" ", "But it was not so. ", "The shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power, to his own startled ears, than it actually possessed. ", "The town did not awake; ", "or, if it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of witches; ", "whose voices, at that period, were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages, as they rode with Satan through the air. ", "The clergyman, therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered his eyes and looked about him. ", "At one of the chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham's mansion, which stood at some distance, on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure. ", "He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the grave. ", "The cry had evidently startled him. ", "At another window of the same house, moreover, appeared old Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far off, revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. ", "She thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward. ", "Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr. Dimmesdale's outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamor of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to make excursions into the forest. ", "Detecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham's lamp, the old lady quickly extinguished her own, and vanished. ", "Possibly, she went up among the clouds. ", "The minister saw nothing further of her motions. ", "The magistrate, after a wary observation of the darkness,-into which, nevertheless, he could see but little further than he might into a mill-stone,-retired from the window. ", "The minister grew comparatively calm. ", "His eyes, however, were soon greeted by a little, glimmering light, which, at first a long way off, was approaching up the street. ", "It threw a gleam of recognition on here a post, and there a garden-fence, and here a latticed window-pane, and there a pump, with its full trough of water, and here, again, an arched door of oak, with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the doorstep. ", "The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars, even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard; ", "and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him, in a few moments more, and reveal his long-hidden secret. ", "As the light drew nearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman,-or, to speak more accurately, his professional father, as well as highly valued friend,-the Reverend Mr. Wilson; ", "who, as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the bedside of some dying man. ", "And so he had. ", "The good old minister came freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop, who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour. ", "And now, surrounded, like the saint-like personages of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sin,-as if the departed Governor had left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city, while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates,-now, in short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward, aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern! ", "The glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale, who smiled,-nay, almost laughed at them,-and then wondered if he were going mad. ", "As the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely muffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding the lantern before his breast with the other, the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking. ", "\"A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! ", "Come up hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!\" ", "Good heavens! ", "Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? ", "For one instant, he believed that these words had passed his lips. ", "But they were uttered only within his imagination. ", "The venerable Father Wilson continued to step slowly onward, looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet, and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform. ", "When the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away, the minister discovered, by the faintness which came over him, that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety; ", "although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness. ", "Shortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought. ", "He felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold. ", "Morning would break, and find him there. ", "The neighborhood would begin to rouse itself. ", "The earliest riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of shame; ", "and, half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go, knocking from door to door, summoning all the people to behold the ghost-as he needs must think it-of some defunct transgressor. ", "A dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. ", "Then-the morning light still waxing stronger-old patriarchs would rise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames, without pausing to put off their night-gear. ", "The whole tribe of decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry, would start into public view, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects. ", "Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his King James's ruff fastened askew; ", "and Mistress Hibbins, with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer than ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride; ", "and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half the night at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early, out of his dreams about the glorified saints. ", "Hither, likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale's church, and the young virgins who so idolized their minister, and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms; ", "which now, by the by, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. ", "All people, in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold. ", "Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow? ", "Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing where Hester Prynne had stood! ", "Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister, unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great peal of laughter. ", "It was immediately responded to by a light, airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the ", "heart,-but he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as acute,-he recognized the tones of little Pearl. \" ", "Pearl! ", "Little Pearl!\" cried he after a moment's pause; ", "then, suppressing his voice,-\"Hester! ", "Hester Prynne! ", "Are you there?\" ", "Yes; ", "it is Hester Prynne!\" ", "she replied, in a tone of surprise; ", "and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the sidewalk, along which she had been passing. ", "\" It is I, and my little Pearl.\" ", "\"Whence come you, Hester?\" asked the minister. ", "\" What sent you hither?\" ", "\"I have been watching at a death-bed,\" answered Hester Prynne;-\"at Governor Winthrop's death-bed, and have taken his measure for a robe, and am now going homeward to my dwelling.\" ", "\"Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,\" said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "\" Ye have both been here before, but I was not with you. ", "Come up hither once again, and we will stand all three together!\" ", "She silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform, holding little Pearl by the hand. ", "The minister felt for the child's other hand, and took it. ", "The moment that he did so, there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life, other life than his own, pouring like a torrent into his heart, and hurrying through all his veins, as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system. ", "The three formed an electric chain. \" ", "Minister!\" whispered little Pearl. ", "\"What wouldst thou say, child?\" asked Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "Wilt thou stand here with mother and me, to-morrow noontide?\" inquired Pearl. ", "Nay; ", "not so, my little Pearl,\" answered the minister; ", "for, with the new energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure, that had so long been the anguish of his life, had returned upon him; ", "and he was already trembling at the conjunction in which-with a strange joy, nevertheless-he now found himself. \" ", "Not so, my child. ", "I shall, indeed, stand with thy mother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow. ", "Pearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand. ", "But the minister held it fast. ", "A moment longer, my child!\" said he. ", "\"But wilt thou promise,\" asked Pearl, \"to take my hand, and mother's hand, to-morrow noontide?\" ", "\"Not then, Pearl,\" said the minister, \"but another time.\" ", "\"And what other time?\" persisted the child. ", "\"At the great judgment day,\" whispered the minister,-and, strangely enough, the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so. ", "\" Then, and there, before the judgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and I must stand together. ", "But the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting!\" ", "Pearl laughed again. ", "[Illustration: ", "They stood in the noon of that strange splendor\"]   ", "But, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky. ", "It was doubtless caused by one of those meteors, which the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to waste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere. ", "So powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth. ", "The great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense lamp. ", "It showed the familiar scene of the street, with the distinctness of mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. ", "The wooden houses, with their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; ", "the doorsteps and thresholds, with the early grass springing up about them; ", "the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth; ", "the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, margined with green on either side;-all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before. ", "And there stood the minister, with his hand over his heart; ", "and ", "Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; ", "and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link between those two. ", "They stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendor, as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another. ", "There was witchcraft in little Pearl's eyes, and her face, as she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish. ", "She withdrew her hand from Mr. Dimmesdale's, and pointed across the street. ", "But he clasped both his hands over his breast, and cast his eyes towards the zenith. ", "Nothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret all meteoric appearances, and other natural phenomena, that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon, as so many revelations from a supernatural source. ", "Thus, a blazing spear, a sword of flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows, seen in the midnight sky, prefigured Indian warfare. ", "Pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light. ", "We doubt whether any marked event, for good or evil, ever befell New England, from its settlement down to Revolutionary times, of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of this nature. ", "Not seldom, it had been seen by multitudes. ", "Oftener, however, its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonder through the colored, magnifying, and distorting medium of his imagination, and shaped it more distinctly in his after-thought. ", "It was, indeed, a majestic idea, that the destiny of nations should be revealed, in these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. ", "A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansive for Providence to write a people's doom upon. ", "The belief was a favorite one with our forefathers, as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness. ", "But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record! ", "In such a case, it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a man, rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, and secret pain, had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature, until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul's history and fate! ", "We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,-the letter A,-marked out in lines of dull red light. ", "Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil of cloud; ", "but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it; ", "or, at least, with so little definiteness, that another's guilt might have seen another symbol in it. ", "There was a singular circumstance that characterized Mr. Dimmesdale's psychological state, at this moment. ", "All the time that he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from the scaffold. ", "The minister appeared to see him, with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. ", "To his features, as to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression; ", "or it might well be that the physician was not careful then, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim. ", "Certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment, then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing there with a smile and scowl, to claim his own. ", "So vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister's perception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated. ", "\"Who is that man, Hester?\" gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcome with terror. ", "\" I shiver at him! ", "Dost thou know the man? ", "I hate him, Hester!\" ", "She remembered her oath, and was silent. ", "\"I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!\" muttered the minister again. ", "\"Who is he? ", "Who is he? ", "Canst thou do nothing for me? ", "I have a nameless horror of the man!\" ", "\"Minister,\" said little Pearl, \"I can tell thee who he is!\" ", "\"Quickly, then, child!\" said the minister, bending his ear close to her lips. ", "\" Quickly!-and as low as thou canst whisper. ", "\" Pearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded, indeed, like human language, but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with, by the hour together. ", "At all events, if it involved any secret information in regard to old Roger Chillingworth, it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman, and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind. ", "The elvish child then laughed aloud. ", "Dost thou mock me now?\" said the minister. ", "Thou wast not bold!-thou wast not true!\"-answered the child. ", "Thou wouldst not promise to take my hand, and mother's hand, to-morrow noontide!\" ", "\"Worthy Sir,\" answered the physician, who had now advanced to the foot of the platform. ", "\" Pious Master Dimmesdale, can this be you? ", "Well, well, indeed! ", "We men of study, whose heads are in our books, have need to be straitly looked after! ", "We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our sleep. ", "Come, good Sir, and my dear friend, I pray you, let me lead you home!\" ", "\"How knewest thou that I was here?\" asked the minister, fearfully. \" ", "Verily, and in good faith,\" answered Roger Chillingworth, \"I knew nothing of the matter. ", "I had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop, doing what my poor skill might to give him ease. ", "He going home to a better world, I, likewise, was on my way homeward, when this strange light shone out. ", "Come with me, I beseech you, Reverend Sir; ", "else you will be poorly able to do Sabbath duty to-morrow. ", "Aha! see now, how they trouble the brain,-these books!-these books! ", "You should study less, good Sir, and take a little pastime; ", "or these night-whimseys will grow upon you.\" ", "\"I will go home with you,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "With a chill despondency, like one awaking, all nerveless, from an ugly dream, he yielded himself to the physician, and was led away. ", "The next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful, and the most replete with heavenly influences, that had ever proceeded from his lips. ", "Souls, it is said more souls than one, were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon, and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter. ", "But, as he came down the pulpit steps, the gray-bearded sexton met him, holding up a black glove, which the minister recognized as his own. ", "\"It was found,\" said the sexton, \"this morning, on the scaffold where evil-doers are set up to public shame. ", "Satan dropped it there, I take it, intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence. ", "But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as he ever and always is. ", "A pure hand needs no glove to cover it!\" ", "\"Thank you, my good friend,\" said the minister, gravely, but startled at heart; ", "for, so confused was his remembrance, that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary. ", "\"Yes, it seems to be my glove, indeed!\" ", "\"And since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence must needs handle him without gloves, henceforward,\" remarked the old sexton, grimly smiling. ", "\" But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?-a great red letter in the sky,-the letter A, which we interpret to stand for Angel. ", "For, as our good Governor Winthrop was made an angel this past night, it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof!\" ", "\"No,\" answered the minister, \"I had not heard of it.\" ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                             XIII. ", "ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER. ", "In her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced. ", "His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed. ", "His moral force was abased into more than childish weakness. ", "It grovelled helpless on the ground, even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength, or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have given them. ", "With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others, she could readily infer that, besides the legitimate action of his own conscience, a terrible machinery had been brought to bear, and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale's well-being and repose. ", "Knowing what this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to her,-the outcast woman,-for support against his instinctively discovered enemy. ", "She decided, moreover, that he had a right to her utmost aid. ", "Little accustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself, Hester saw-or seemed to see-that there lay a responsibility upon her, in reference to the clergyman, which she owed to no other, nor to the whole world besides. ", "The links that united her to the rest of human kind-links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the material-had all been broken. ", "Here was the iron link of mutual crime, which neither he nor she could break. ", "Like all other ties, it brought along with it its obligations. ", "Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy. ", "Years had come and gone. ", "Pearl was now seven years old. ", "Her mother, with the scarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic embroidery, had long been a familiar object to the towns-people. ", "As is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community, and, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience, a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to Hester Prynne. ", "It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. ", "Hatred, by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility. ", "In this matter of Hester Prynne, there was neither irritation nor irksomeness. ", "She never battled with the public, but submitted, uncomplainingly, to its worst usage; ", "she made no claim upon it, in requital for what she suffered; ", "she did not weigh upon its sympathies. ", "Then, also, the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy, was reckoned largely in her favor. ", "With nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything, it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths. ", "[Illustration: ", "Hester in the House of Mourning]   ", "It was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the world's privileges,-further than to breathe the common air, and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the faithful labor of her hands,-she was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man, whenever benefits were to be conferred. ", "None so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty; ", "even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch's robe. ", "None so self-devoted as Hester, when pestilence stalked through the town. ", "In all seasons of calamity, indeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at once found her place. ", "She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful inmate, into the household that was darkened by trouble; ", "as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creatures. ", "There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in its unearthly ray. ", "Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of the sick-chamber. ", "It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer's hard extremity, across the verge of time. ", "It had shown him where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fast becoming dim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him. ", "In such emergencies, Hester's nature showed itself warm and rich; ", "a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. ", "Her breast, with its badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one. ", "She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy; ", "or, we may rather say, the world's heavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result. ", "The letter was the symbol of her calling. ", "Such helpfulness was found in her,-so much power to do, and power to sympathize,-that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. ", "They said that it meant Able; ", "so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength. ", "It was only the darkened house that could contain her. ", "When sunshine came again, she was not there. ", "Her shadow had faded across the threshold. ", "The helpful inmate had departed, without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously. ", "Meeting them in the street, she never raised her head to receive their greeting. ", "If they were resolute to accost her, she laid her finger on the scarlet letter, and passed on. ", "This might be pride, but was so like humility, that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind. ", "The public is despotic in its temper; ", "it is capable of denying common justice, when too strenuously demanded as a right; ", "but quite as frequently it awards more than justice, when the appeal is made, as despots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity. ", "Interpreting Hester Prynne's deportment as an appeal of this nature, society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favored with, or, perchance, than she deserved. ", "The rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community, were longer in acknowledging the influence of Hester's good qualities than the people. ", "The prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning, that made it a far tougher labor to expel them. ", "Day by day, nevertheless, their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in the due course of years, might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence. ", "Thus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals. ", "Individuals in private life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her frailty; ", "nay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token, not of that one sin, for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance, but of her many good deeds since. ", "\" Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?\" they would say to strangers. ", "\" It is our Hester,-the town's own Hester, who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so comfortable to the afflicted!\" ", "Then, it is true, the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodied in the person of another, would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years. ", "It was none the less a fact, however, that, in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus, the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun's bosom. ", "It imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril. ", "Had she fallen among thieves, it would have kept her safe. ", "It was reported, and believed by many, that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge, and that the missile struck it, but fell harmless to the ground. ", "The effect of the symbol-or, rather, of the position in respect to society that was indicated by it-on the mind of Hester Prynne herself, was powerful and peculiar. ", "All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, which might have been repulsive, had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it. ", "Even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change. ", "It might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. ", "It was a sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine. ", "It was due in part to all these causes, but still more to something else, that there seemed to be no longer anything in Hester's face for Love to dwell upon; ", "nothing in Hester's form, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace; ", "nothing in Hester's bosom, to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. ", "Some attribute had departed from her, the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman. ", "Such is frequently the fate, and such the stern development, of the feminine character and person, when the woman has encountered, and lived through, an experience of peculiar severity. ", "If she be all tenderness, she will die. ", "If she survive, the tenderness will either be crushed out of her, or-and the outward semblance is the same-crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more. ", "The latter is perhaps the truest theory. ", "She who has once been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transfiguration. ", "We shall see whether Hester Prynne were ever afterwards so touched, and so transfigured. ", "Much of the marble coldness of Hester's impression was to be attributed to the circumstance, that her life had turned, in a great measure, from passion and feeling, to thought. ", "Standing alone in the world,-alone, as to any dependence on society, and with little Pearl to be guided and protected,-alone, and hopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to consider it desirable,-she cast away the fragments of a broken chain. ", "The world's law was no law for her mind. ", "It was an age in which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before. ", "Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings. ", "Men bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged-not actually, but within the sphere of theory, which was their most real abode-the whole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linked much of ancient principle. ", "Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit. ", "She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet letter. ", "In her lonesome cottage, by the sea-shore, thoughts visited her, such as dared to enter no other dwelling in New England; ", "shadowy guests, that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer, could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door. ", "It is remarkable, that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society. ", "The thought suffices them, without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action. ", "So it seemed to be with Hester. ", "Yet, had little Pearl never come to her from the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise. ", "Then, she might have come down to us in history, hand in hand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious sect. ", "She might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess. ", "She might, and not improbably would, have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period, for attempting to undermine the foundations of the Puritan establishment. ", "But, in the education of her child, the mother's enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon. ", "Providence, in the person of this little girl, had assigned to Hester's charge the germ and blossom of womanhood, to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties. ", "Everything was against her. ", "The world was hostile. ", "The child's own nature had something wrong in it, which continually betokened that she had been born amiss,-the effluence of her mother's lawless passion,-and often impelled Hester to ask, in bitterness of heart, whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all. ", "Indeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind, with reference to the whole race of womanhood. ", "Was existence worth accepting, even to the happiest among them? ", "As concerned her own individual existence, she had long ago decided in the negative, and dismissed the point as settled. ", "A tendency to speculation, though it may keep woman quiet, as it does man, yet makes her sad. ", "She discerns, it may be, such a hopeless task before her. ", "As a first step, the whole system of society is to be torn down, and built up anew. ", "Then, the very nature of the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which has become like nature, is to be essentially modified, before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position. ", "Finally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change; ", "in which, perhaps, the ethereal essence, wherein she has her truest life, will be found to have evaporated. ", "A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought. ", "They are not to be solved, or only in one way. ", "If her heart chance to come uppermost, they vanish. ", "Thus, Hester Prynne, whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew in the dark labyrinth of mind; ", "now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice; ", "now starting back from a deep chasm. ", "There was wild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfort nowhere. ", "At times, a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to heaven, and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide. ", "The scarlet letter had not done its office. ", "Now, however, her interview with the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the night of his vigil, had given her a new theme of reflection, and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment. ", "She had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled, or, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. ", "She saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not already stepped across it. ", "It was impossible to doubt, that, whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse, a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief. ", "A secret enemy had been continually by his side, under the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale's nature. ", "Hester could not but ask herself, whether there had not originally been a defect of truth, courage, and loyalty, on her own part, in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded, and nothing auspicious to be hoped. ", "Her only justification lay in the fact, that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself, except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth's scheme of disguise. ", "Under that impulse, she had made her choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretched alternative of the two. ", "She determined to redeem her error, so far as it might yet be possible. ", "Strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial, she felt herself ", "no longer so inadequate to cope with Roger Chillingworth as on that night, abased by sin, and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new, when they had talked together in the prison-chamber. ", "She had climbed her way, since then, to a higher point. ", "The old man, on the other hand, had brought himself nearer to her level, or perhaps below it, by the revenge which he had stooped for. ", "In fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe. ", "The occasion was not long to seek. ", "One afternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician, with a basket on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stooping along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicines withal. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                             XIV. ", "HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN. ", "Hester bade little Pearl run down to the margin of the water, and play with the shells and tangled sea-weed, until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs. ", "So the child flew away like a bird, and, making bare her small white feet, went pattering along the moist margin of the sea. ", "Here and there she came to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a pool, left by the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in. ", "Forth peeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image of a little maid, whom Pearl, having no other playmate, invited to take her hand, and run a race with her. ", "But the visionary little maid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say,-\"This is a better place! ", "Come thou into the pool!\" ", "And Pearl, stepping in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom; ", "while, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water. ", "Meanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician. ", "\"I would speak a word with you,\" said she,-\"a word that concerns us much.\" ", "\"Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger Chillingworth?\" answered he, raising himself from his stooping posture. ", "With all my heart! ", "Why, Mistress, I hear good tidings of you on all hands! ", "No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, a wise and godly man, was discoursing of your affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council. ", "It was debated whether or no, with safety to the common weal, yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom. ", "On my life, Hester, I made my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith!\" ", "\"It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off this badge,\" calmly replied Hester. \" ", "Were I worthy to be quit of it, it would fall away of its own nature, or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport.\" ", "\"Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,\" rejoined he. ", "\" A woman must needs follow her own fancy, touching the adornment of her person. ", "The letter is gayly embroidered, and shows right bravely on your bosom! ", "\" All this while, Hester had been looking steadily at the old man, and was shocked, as well as wonder-smitten, to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years. ", "It was not so much that he had grown older; ", "for though the traces of advancing life were visible, he bore his age well, and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness. ", "But the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man, calm and quiet, which was what she best remembered in him, had altogether vanished, and been succeeded by an eager, searching, almost fierce, yet carefully guarded look. ", "It seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile; ", "but the latter played him false, and flickered over his visage so derisively, that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it. ", "Ever and anon, too, there came a glare of red light out of his eyes; ", "as if the old man's soul were on fire, and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast, until, by some casual puff of passion, it was blown into a momentary flame. ", "This he repressed, as speedily as possible, and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened. ", "In a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence of man's faculty of transforming himself into a devil, if he will only, for a reasonable space of time, undertake a devil's office. ", "This unhappy person had effected such a transformation, by devoting himself, for seven years, to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture, and deriving his enjoyment thence, and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloated over. ", "The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne's bosom. ", "Here was another ruin, the responsibility of which came partly home to her. ", "\"What see you in my face,\" asked the physician, \"that you look at it so earnestly?\" ", "\"Something that would make me weep, if there were any tears bitter enough for it,\" answered she. \" ", "But let it pass! ", "It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak.\" ", "\"And what of him?\" cried Roger Chillingworth, eagerly, as if he loved the topic, and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant. ", "\" Not to hide the truth, Mistress Hester, my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the gentleman. ", "So speak freely; ", "and I will make answer.\" ", "\"When we last spake together,\" said Hester, \"now seven years ago, it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy, as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me.

", "Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!\" cried old Roger Chillingworth, letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes. ", "Better had he died at once! ", "Never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered. ", "And all, all, in the sight of his worst enemy! ", "He has been conscious of me. ", "He has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse. ", "He knew, by some spiritual sense,-for the Creator never made another being so sensitive as this,-he knew that no friendly hand was pulling at his heart-strings, and that an eye was looking curiously into him, which sought only evil, and found it. ", "But he knew not that the eye and hand were mine! ", "With the superstition common to his brotherhood, he fancied himself given over to a fiend, to be tortured with frightful dreams, and desperate thoughts, the sting of remorse, and despair of pardon; ", "as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave. ", "But it was the constant shadow of my presence!-the closest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wronged!-and who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst revenge!

", "A mortal man, with once a human heart, has become a fiend for his especial torment!\" ", "The unfortunate physician, while uttering these words, lifted his hands with a look of horror, as if he had beheld some frightful shape, which he could not recognize, usurping the place of his own image in a glass. ", "It was one of those moments-which sometimes occur only at the interval of years-when a man's moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind's eye. ", "Not improbably, he had never before viewed himself as he did now. \" ", "Hast thou not tortured him enough?\" said Hester, noticing the old man's look. \" ", "Has he not paid thee all?\" ", "\"No!-no!-He has but increased the debt!\" answered the physician; ", "and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer characteristics, and subsided into gloom. ", "\" Dost thou remember me, Hester, as I was nine years agone? ", "Even then, I was in the autumn of my days, nor was it the early autumn. ", "But all my life had been made up of earnest, studious, thoughtful, quiet years, bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge, and faithfully, too, though this latter object was but casual to the other,-faithfully for the advancement of human welfare. ", "No life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine; ", "few lives so rich with benefits conferred. ", "Dost thou remember me?

", "The thought occurred to Hester, that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as she knew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy. ", "It showed Pearl in an unwonted aspect. ", "Heretofore, the mother, while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection, had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an April breeze; ", "which spends its time in airy sport, and has its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in its best of moods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take it to your bosom; ", "in requital of which misdemeanors, it will sometimes, of its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then be gone about its other idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart. ", "And this, moreover, was a mother's estimate of the child's disposition. ", "Any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits, and have given them a far darker coloring. ", "But now the idea came strongly into Hester's mind, that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might already have approached the age when she could be made a friend, and intrusted with as much of her mother's sorrows as could be imparted, without irreverence either to the parent or the child. ", "In the little chaos of Pearl's character there might be seen emerging-and could have been, from the very first-the steadfast principles of an unflinching courage,-an uncontrollable will,-a sturdy pride, which might be disciplined into self-respect,-and a bitter scorn of many things, which, when examined, might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them. ", "She possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and disagreeable, as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit. ", "With all these sterling attributes, thought Hester, the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed, if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child. ", "Pearl's inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being. ", "From the earliest epoch of her conscious life, she had entered upon this as her appointed mission. ", "Hester had often fancied that Providence had a design of justice and retribution, in endowing the child with this marked propensity; ", "but never, until now, had she bethought herself to ask, whether, linked with that design, there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence. ", "If little Pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child, might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother's heart, and converted it into a tomb?-and to help her to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead nor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart? ", "Such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester's mind, with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear. ", "And there was little Pearl, all this while, holding her mother's hand in both her own, and turning her face upward, while she put these searching questions, once, and again, and still a third time. ", "\"What does the letter mean, mother?-and why dost thou wear it?-and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?\" ", "\"What shall I say?\" thought Hester to herself. \" ", "No! ", "If this be the price of the child's sympathy, I cannot pay it. ", "Then she spoke aloud. \" ", "Silly Pearl,\" said she, \"what questions are these? ", "There are many things in this world that a child must not ask about. ", "What know I of the minister's heart? ", "And as for the scarlet letter, I wear it for the sake of its gold-thread.\" ", "In all the seven bygone years, Hester Prynne had never before been false to the symbol on her bosom. ", "It may be that it was the talisman of a stern and severe, but yet a guardian spirit, who now forsook her; ", "as recognizing that, in spite of his strict watch over her heart, some new evil had crept into it, or some old one had never been expelled. ", "As for little Pearl, the earnestness soon passed out of her face. ", "But the child did not see fit to let the matter drop. ", "Two or three times, as her mother ", "and she went homeward, and as often at supper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed, and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up, with mischief gleaming in her black eyes. ", "\"Mother,\" said she, \"what does the scarlet letter mean? ", "And the next morning, the first indication the child gave of being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow, and making that other inquiry, which she had so unaccountably connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter: ", "-  \"Mother!-Mother!-Why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?\" ", "\"Hold thy tongue, naughty child!\" answered her mother, with an asperity that she had never permitted to herself before. ", "\" Do not tease me; ", "else I shall shut thee into the dark closet!\" ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                             XVI. ", "A FOREST WALK. ", "Hester Prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to Mr. Dimmesdale, at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences, the true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy. ", "For several days, however, she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking, along the shores of the peninsula, or on the wooded hills of the neighboring country. ", "There would have been no scandal, indeed, nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergyman's good fame, had she visited him in his own study; ", "where many a penitent, ere now, had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by the scarlet letter. ", "But, partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference of old Roger Chillingworth, and partly that her conscious heart imputed suspicion where none could have been felt, and partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to breathe in, while they talked together,-for all these reasons, Hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky. ", "At last, while attending in a sick-chamber, whither the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, she learnt that he had gone, the day before, to visit the Apostle Eliot, among his Indian converts. ", "He would probably return, by a certain hour, in the afternoon of the morrow. ", "Betimes, therefore, the next day, Hester took little Pearl,-who was necessarily the companion of all her mother's expeditions, however inconvenient her presence,-and set forth. ", "The road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula to the mainland, was no other than a footpath. ", "It straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest. ", "This hemmed it in so narrowly, and stood so black and dense on either side, and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that, to Hester's mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering. ", "The day was chill and sombre. ", "Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly stirred, however, by a breeze; ", "so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path. ", "This flitting cheerfulness was always at the farther extremity of some long vista through the forest. ", "The sportive sunlight-feebly sportive, at best, in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scene-withdrew itself as they came nigh, and left the spots where it had danced the drearier, because they had hoped to find them bright. \" ", "Mother,\" said little Pearl, \"the sunshine does not love you. ", "It runs away and hides itself, because it is afraid of something on your bosom. ", "Now, see! ", "There it is, playing, a good way off. ", "Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. ", "I am but a child. ", "It will not flee from me; ", "for I wear nothing on my bosom yet!\" ", "\"Nor ever will, my child, I hope,\" said Hester. ", "And why not, mother?\" asked Pearl, stopping short, just at the beginning of her race. ", "Will not it come of its own accord, when I am a woman grown?\" ", "\"Run away, child,\" answered her mother, \"and catch the sunshine! ", "It will soon be gone.\" ", "Pearl set forth, at a great pace, and, as Hester smiled to perceive, did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in the midst of it, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion. ", "The light lingered about the lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too. ", "\"It will go now,\" said Pearl, shaking her head. ", "\"See!\" answered Hester, smiling. ", "\" Now I can stretch out my hand, and grasp some of it.\" ", "As she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; ", "or, to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on Pearl's features, her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself, and would give it forth again, with a gleam about her path, as they should plunge into some gloomier shade. ", "There was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in Pearl's nature, as this never-failing vivacity of spirits; ", "she had not the disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter days, inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors. ", "Perhaps this too was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild energy with which Hester had fought against her sorrows, before Pearl's birth. ", "It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard, metallic lustre to the child's character. ", "She wanted-what some people want throughout life-a grief that should deeply touch her, and thus humanize and make her capable of sympathy. ", "But there was time enough yet for little Pearl. \" ", "Come, my child!\" said Hester, looking about her from the spot where Pearl had stood still in the sunshine. ", "\" We will sit down a little way within the wood, and rest ourselves.\" ", "\"I am not aweary, mother,\" replied the little girl. ", "\" But you may sit down, if you will tell me a story meanwhile.\" ", "\"A story, child!\" said Hester. \" ", "And about what?\" ", "\"O, a story about the Black Man,\" answered Pearl, taking hold of her mother's gown, and looking up, half earnestly, half mischievously, into her face. ", "\" How he haunts this forest, and carries a book with him,-a big, heavy book, with iron clasps; ", "and how this ugly Black Man offers his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among the trees; ", "and they are to write their names with their own blood. ", "And then he sets his mark on their bosoms! ", "Didst thou ever meet the Black Man, mother?\" ", "\"And who told you this story, Pearl?\" asked her mother, recognizing a common superstition of the period. ", "\"It was the old dame in the chimney-corner, at the house where you watched last night,\" said the child. ", "\" But she fancied me asleep while she was talking of it. ", "She said that a thousand and a thousand people had met him here, and had written in his book, and have his mark on them. ", "And that ugly-tempered lady, old Mistress Hibbins, was one. ", "And, mother, the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man's mark on thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight, here in the dark wood. ", "Is it true, mother? ", "And dost thou go to meet him in the night-time?\" ", "\"Didst thou ever awake, and find thy mother gone?\" asked Hester. ", "\"Not that I remember,\" said the child. ", "\" If thou fearest to leave me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee. ", "I would very gladly go! ", "But, mother, tell me now! ", "Is there such a Black Man? ", "And didst thou ever meet him? ", "And is this his mark?\" ", "\"Wilt thou let me be at peace, if I once tell thee?\" asked her mother. ", "\"Yes, if thou tellest me all,\" answered Pearl. ", "\"Once in my life I met the Black Man!\" said her mother. ", "\" This scarlet letter is his mark!\" ", "Thus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the forest track. ", "Here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss; ", "which, at some epoch of the preceding century, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere. ", "It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. ", "The trees impending over it had flung down great branches, from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points; ", "while, in its swifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channel-way of pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. ", "Letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens. ", "All these giant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook; ", "fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool. ", "Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue. \" ", "O brook! ", "O foolish and tiresome little brook!\" cried Pearl, after listening awhile to its talk. ", "\" Why art thou so sad? ", "Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring!\" ", "But the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the forest-trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it, and seemed to have nothing else to say. ", "Pearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a well-spring as mysterious, and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom. ", "But, unlike the little stream, she danced and sparkled, and prattled airily along her course. ", "\"What does this sad little brook say, mother?\" inquired she. ", "\"If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee of it,\" answered her mother, \"even as it is telling me of mine! ", "But now, Pearl, I hear a footstep along the path, and the noise of one putting aside the branches. ", "I would have thee betake thyself to play, and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder.\" ", "\"Is it the Black Man?\" asked Pearl. ", "Wilt thou go and play, child?\" repeated her mother. ", "\" But do not stray far into the wood. ", "And take heed that thou come at my first call.\" ", "\"Yes, mother,\" answered Pearl. \" ", "But if it be the Black Man, wilt thou not let me stay a moment, and look at him, with his big book under his arm?\" ", "\"Go, silly child!\" said her mother, impatiently. ", "\" It is no Black Man! ", "Thou canst see him now, through the trees. ", "It is the minister!\" ", "\"And so it is!\" said the child. \" ", "And, mother, he has his hand over his heart! ", "Is it because, when the minister wrote his name in the book, the Black Man set his mark in that place? ", "But why does he not wear it outside his bosom, as thou dost, mother?\" ", "\"Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time,\" cried Hester Prynne. ", "\" But do not stray far. ", "Keep where thou canst hear the babble of the brook. ", "\" The child went singing away, following up the current of the brook, and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice. ", "But the little stream would not be comforted, and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happened-or making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happen-within the verge of the dismal forest. ", "So Pearl, who had enough of shadow in her own little life, chose to break off all acquaintance with this repining brook. ", "She set herself, therefore, to gathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevices of a high rock. ", "When her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest, but still remained under the deep shadow of the trees. ", "She beheld the minister advancing along the path, entirely alone, and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the wayside. ", "He looked haggard and feeble, and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air, which had never so remarkably characterized him in his walks about the settlement, nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice. ", "Here it was wofully visible, in this intense seclusion of the forest, which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits. ", "There was a listlessness in his gait; ", "as if he saw no reason for taking one step farther, nor felt any desire to do so, but would have been glad, could he be glad of anything, to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree, and lie there passive, forevermore. ", "The leaves might bestrew him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame, no matter whether there were life in it or no. ", "Death was too definite an object to be wished for, or avoided. ", "To Hester's eye, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of positive and vivacious suffering, except that, as little Pearl had remarked, he kept his hand over his heart.

", "Slowly as the minister walked, he had almost gone by, before Hester Prynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation. ", "At length, she succeeded. \" ", "Arthur Dimmesdale!\" ", "she said, faintly at first; ", "then louder, but hoarsely. \" ", "Arthur Dimmesdale!\" ", "\"Who speaks?\" answered the minister. ", "Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses. ", "Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. ", "It may be, that his pathway through life was haunted thus, by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts. ", "He made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter. \" ", "Hester! ", "Hester Prynne!\" said he. ", "\" Is it thou? ", "Art thou in life?\" ", "\"Even so! ", "\" she answered. ", "\" In such life as has been mine these seven years past! ", "And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dost thou yet live? ", "\" It was no wonder that they thus questioned one another's actual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. ", "So strangely did they meet, in the dim wood, that it was like the first encounter, in the world beyond the grave, of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life, but now stood coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; ", "as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings. ", "Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost! ", "They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves; ", "because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its history and experience, as life never does, except at such breathless epochs. ", "The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment. ", "It was with fear, and tremulously, and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. ", "The grasp, cold as it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. ", "They now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere. ", "Without a word more spoken,-neither he nor she assuming the guidance, but with an unexpressed consent,-they glided back into the shadow of the woods, whence Hester had emerged, and sat down on the heap of moss where she and Pearl had before been sitting. ", "When they found voice to speak, it was, at first, only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintance might have made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening storm, and, next, the health of each. ", "Thus they went onward, not boldly, but step by step, into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts. ", "So long estranged by fate and circumstances, they needed something slight and casual to run before, and throw open the doors of intercourse, so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold. ", "After a while, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester Prynne's. \" ", "Hester,\" said he, \"hast thou found peace?\" ", "She smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom. \" ", "Hast thou? ", "\" she asked. \" ", "None!-nothing but despair!\" ", "he answered. ", "\" What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?

", "I have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am! ", "And Satan laughs at it!\" ", "\"You wrong yourself in this,\" said Hester, gently. ", "\" You have deeply and sorely repented. ", "Your sin is left behind you, in the days long past. ", "Your present life is not less holy, in very truth, than it seems in people's eyes.

", "But this had been a sin of passion, not of principle, nor even purpose. ", "Since that wretched epoch, he had watched, with morbid zeal and minuteness, not his acts,-for those it was easy to arrange,-but each breath of emotion, and his every thought. ", "At the head of the social system, as the clergymen of that day stood, he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its principles, and even its prejudices. ", "As a priest, the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in. ", "As a man who had once sinned, but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound, he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all. ", "Thus, we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour. ", "But Arthur Dimmesdale! Were such a man once more to fall, what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime? ", "None; ", "unless it avail him somewhat, that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering; ", "that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it; ", "that, between fleeing as an avowed criminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might find it hard to strike the balance; ", "that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy, and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy; ", "that, finally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary and desert path, faint, sick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy, a new life, and a true one, in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating.

", "The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood's heart of mystery, which had become a mystery of joy.

", "A fox, startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked inquisitively at Pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal off, or renew his nap on the same spot. ", "A wolf, it is said,-but here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable,-came up, and smelt of Pearl's robe, and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand. ", "The truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest, and these wild things which it nourished, all recognized a kindred wildness in the human child.

", "The flowers appeared to know it; ", "and one and another whispered as she passed, \"Adorn thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adorn thyself with me!\"-and, to please them, Pearl gathered the violets, and anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of the freshest green, which the old trees held down before her eyes. ", "With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, and became a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood.

", "It was strange, the way in which Pearl stood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest-gloom; ", "herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy. ", "In the brook beneath stood another child,-another and the same,-with likewise its ray of golden light. ", "Hester felt herself, in some indistinct and tantalizing manner, estranged from Pearl; ", "as if the child, in her lonely ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to return to it. ", "There was both truth and error in the impression; ", "the child and mother were estranged, but through Hester's fault, not Pearl's. ", "Since the latter rambled from her side, another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mother's feelings, and so modified the aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returning wanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knew where she was.

", "Else I must come to thee!\" ", "But Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother's threats, any more than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions. ", "She accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated on all sides; ", "so that, alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement. ", "Seen in the brook, once more, was the shadowy wrath of Pearl's image, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot, wildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing its small forefinger at Hester's bosom!

", "\" Come and ask his blessing!\" ", "But, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favor to the clergyman.

", "And the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore. ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                              XX. ", "THE MINISTER IN A MAZE. ", "As the minister departed, in advance of Hester Prynne and little Pearl, he threw a backward glance; ", "half expecting that he should discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child, slowly fading into the twilight of the woods. ", "So great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real. ", "But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever since been covering with moss, so that these two fated ones, with earth's heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together, and find a single hour's rest and solace. ", "And there was Pearl, too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook,-now that the intrusive third person was gone,-and taking her old place by her mother's side. ", "So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed! ", "In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had sketched for their departure. ", "It had been determined between them, that the Old World, with its crowds and cities, offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of New England, or all America, with its alternatives of an Indian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans, scattered thinly along the seaboard. ", "Not to speak of the clergyman's health, so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life, his native gifts, his culture, and his entire development, would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and refinement; ", "the higher the state, the more delicately adapted to it the man. ", "In furtherance of this choice, it so happened that a ship lay in the harbor; ", "one of those questionable cruisers, frequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of the deep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character. ", "This vessel had recently arrived from the Spanish Main, and, within three days' time, would sail for Bristol. ", "Hester Prynne-whose vocation, as a self-enlisted Sister of Charity, had brought her acquainted with the captain and crew-could take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child, with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable. ", "The minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest, the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart. ", "It would probably be on the fourth day from the present. ", "\" That is most fortunate!\" ", "he had then said to himself. ", "Now, why the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate, we hesitate to reveal. ", "Nevertheless,-to hold nothing back from the reader,-it was because, on the third day from the present, he was to preach the Election Sermon; ", "and, as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life of a New England clergyman, he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional career. ", "\" At least, they shall say of me,\" thought this exemplary man, \"that I leave no public duty unperformed, nor ill performed! ", "Sad, indeed, that an introspection so profound and acute as this poor minister's should be so miserably deceived! ", "We have had, and may still have, worse things to tell of him; ", "but none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak; ", "no evidence, at once so slight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease, that had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his character. ", "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true. ", "The excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale's feelings, as he returned from his interview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical energy, and hurried him townward at a rapid pace. ", "The pathway among the woods seemed wilder, more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles, and less trodden by the foot of man, than he remembered it on his outward journey. ", "But he leaped across the plashy places, thrust himself through the clinging underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow, and overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track, with an unweariable activity that astonished him. ", "He could not but recall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, he had toiled over the same ground, only two days before. ", "As he drew near the town, he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves. ", "It seemed not yesterday, not one, nor two, but many days, or even years ago, since he had quitted them. ", "There, indeed, was each former trace of the street, as he remembered it, and all the peculiarities of the houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and a weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one. ", "Not the less, however, came this importunately obtrusive sense of change. ", "The same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human life, about the little town. ", "They looked neither older nor younger now; ", "the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; ", "it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance; ", "and yet the minister's deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability. ", "A similar impression struck him most remarkably, as he passed under the walls of his own church. ", "The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar, an aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale's mind vibrated between two ideas; ", "either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was merely dreaming about it now. ", "This phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, indicated no external change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. ", "The minister's own will, and Hester's will, and the fate that grew between them, had wrought this transformation. ", "It was the same town as heretofore; ", "but the same minister returned not from the forest. ", "He might have said to the friends who greeted him,-\"I am not the man for whom you take me! ", "I left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a mossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholy brook! ", "Go, seek your minister, and see if his emaciated figure, his thin cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not flung down there, like a cast-off garment!\" ", "His friends, no doubt, would still have insisted with him,-\"Thou art thyself the man!\"-but ", "the error would have been their own, not his. ", "Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling. ", "In truth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in that interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister. ", "At every step he was incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; ", "in spite of himself, yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse. ", "For instance, he met one of his own deacons. ", "The good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege, which his venerable age, his upright and holy character, and his station in the Church, entitled him to use; ", "and, conjoined with this, the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister's professional and private claims alike demanded. ", "Never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower social rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards a higher. ", "Now, during a conversation of some two or three moments between the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon, it was only by the most careful self-control that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind, respecting the communion supper. ", "He absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance of these horrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing, without his having fairly given it. ", "And, even with this terror in his heart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister's impiety! ", "Again, another incident of the same nature. ", "Hurrying along the street, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church; ", "a most pious and exemplary old dame; ", "poor, widowed, lonely, and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children, and her dead friends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storied gravestones. ", "Yet all this, which would else have been such heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul, by religious consolations and the truths of Scripture, wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years. ", "And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the good grandam's chief earthly comfort-which, unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all-was to meet her pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his beloved lips, into her dulled, but rapturously attentive ear. ", "But, on this occasion, up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman's ear, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the great enemy of souls would have it, could recall no text of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul. ", "The instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion. ", "What he really did whisper, the minister could never afterwards recollect. ", "There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow's comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after a method of its own. ", "Assuredly, as the minister looked back, he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled and ashy pale. ", "Again, a third instance. ", "After parting from the old church-member, he met the youngest sister of them all. ", "It was a maiden newly won-and won by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale's own sermon, on the Sabbath after his vigil-to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope, that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her, and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. ", "She was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. ", "The minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting to religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. ", "Satan, that afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her mother's side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted, or-shall we not rather say?-this lost and desperate man. ", "As she drew nigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. ", "Such was his sense of power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look, and develop all its opposite with but a word. ", "So-with a mightier struggle than he had yet sustained-he held his Geneva cloak before his face, and hurried onward, making no sign of recognition, and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. ", "She ransacked her conscience,-which was full of harmless little matters, like her pocket or her work-bag,-and took herself to task, poor thing! for a thousand imaginary faults; ", "and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning. ", "Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous, and almost as horrible. ", "It was,-we blush to tell it,-it was to stop short in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little Puritan children who were playing there, and had but just begun to talk. ", "Denying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman, one of the ship's crew from the Spanish Main. ", "And, here, since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor Mr. Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake hands with the tarry blackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, such as dissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid, satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! ", "It was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste, and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him safely through the latter crisis. ", "\"What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?\" cried the minister to himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand against his forehead. ", "\" Am I mad? or am I given over utterly to the fiend? ", "Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood? ", "And does he now summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive? ", "\" At the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus communed with himself, and struck his forehead with his hand, old Mistress Hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, is said to have been passing by. ", "She made a very grand appearance; ", "having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this last good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury's murder. ", "Whether the witch had read the minister's thoughts, or no, she came to a full stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and-though little given to converse with clergymen-began a conversation. \" ", "So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,\" observed the witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him. ", "\" The next time, I pray you to allow me only a fair warning, and I shall be proud to bear you company. ", "Without taking overmuch upon myself, my good word will go far towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate you wot of!\" ", "\"I profess, madam,\" answered the clergyman, with a grave obeisance, such as the lady's rank demanded, and his own good-breeding made imperative,-\"I profess, on my conscience and character, that I am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words! ", "I went not into the forest to seek a potentate; ", "neither do I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with a view to gaining the favor of such a personage. ", "My one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine, the Apostle Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he hath won from heathendom!\" ", "\"Ha, ha, ha!\" cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding her high head-dress at the minister. ", "\" Well, well, we must needs talk thus in the daytime! ", "You carry it off like an old hand! ", "But at midnight, and in the forest, we shall have other talk together!\" ", "She passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turning back her head and smiling at him, like one willing to recognize a secret intimacy of connection. ", "Have I then sold myself,\" thought the minister, \"to the fiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master! ", "The wretched minister! ", "He had made a bargain very like it! ", "Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself, with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin. ", "And the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system. ", "It had stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones. ", "Scorn, bitterness, unprovoked malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whatever was good and holy, all awoke, to tempt, even while they frightened him. ", "And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if it were a real incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits. ", "He had, by this time, reached his dwelling, on the edge of the burial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge in his study. ", "The minister was glad to have reached this shelter, without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets. ", "He entered the accustomed room, and looked around him on its books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the walls, with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest-dell into the town, and thitherward. ", "Here he had studied and written; ", "here, gone through fast and vigil, and come forth half alive; ", "here, striven to pray; ", "here, borne a hundred thousand agonies! ", "There was the Bible, in its rich old Hebrew, with Moses and the Prophets speaking to him, and God's voice through all! ", "There, on the table, with the inky pen beside it, was an unfinished sermon, with a sentence broken in the midst, where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page, two days before. ", "He knew that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, who had done and suffered these things, and written thus far into the Election Sermon! ", "But he seemed to stand apart, and eye this former self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity. ", "That self was gone. ", "Another man had returned out of the forest; ", "a wiser one; ", "with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached. ", "A bitter kind of knowledge that! ", "While occupied with these reflections, a knock came at the door of the study, and the minister said, \"Come in!\"-not wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit. ", "And so he did! ", "It was old Roger Chillingworth that entered. ", "The minister stood, white and speechless, with one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast. \" ", "Welcome home, reverend Sir,\" said the physician. ", "And how found you that godly man, the Apostle Eliot? ", "But methinks, dear Sir, you look pale; ", "as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you. ", "Will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to preach your Election Sermon?\" ", "\"Nay, I think not so,\" rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. ", "\" My journey, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder, and the free air which I have breathed, have done me good, after so long confinement in my study. ", "I think to need no more of your drugs, my kind physician, good though they be, and administered by a friendly hand. ", "\" All this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient. ", "But, in spite of this outward show, the latter was almost convinced of the old man's knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, with respect to his own interview with Hester Prynne. ", "The physician knew then, that, in the minister's regard, he was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest enemy. ", "So much being known, it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed. ", "It is singular, however, how long a time often passes before words embody things; ", "and with what security two persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approach its very verge, and retire without disturbing it. ", "Thus, the minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth would touch, in express words, upon the real position which they sustained towards one another. ", "Yet did the physician, in his dark way, creep frightfully near the secret. \" ", "Were it not better,\" said he, \"that you use my poor skill to-night? ", "Verily, dear Sir, we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous for this occasion of the Election discourse. ", "The people look for great things from you; ", "apprehending that another year may come about, and find their pastor gone.\" ", "\"Yea, to another world,\" replied the minister, with pious resignation. ", "\"Heaven grant it be a better one; ", "for, in good sooth, I hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year! ", "But, touching your medicine, kind Sir, in my present frame of body, I need it not.\" ", "\"I joy to hear it,\" answered the physician. ", "\" It may be that my remedies, so long administered in vain, begin now to take due effect. ", "Happy man were I, and well deserving of New England's gratitude, could I achieve this cure!\" ", "\"I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,\" said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a solemn smile. ", "\" I thank you, and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers.\" ", "\"A good man's prayers are golden recompense!\" rejoined old Roger Chillingworth, as he took his leave. ", "\" Yea, they are the current gold coin of the New Jerusalem, with the King's own mint-mark on them!\" ", "Left alone, the minister summoned a servant of the house, and requested food, which, being set before him, he ate with ravenous appetite. ", "Then, flinging the already written pages of the Election Sermon into the fire, he forthwith began another, which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion, that he fancied himself inspired; ", "and only wondered that Heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organ-pipe as he. ", "However, leaving that mystery to solve itself, or go unsolved forever, he drove his task onward, with earnest haste and ecstasy. ", "Thus the night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he careering on it; ", "morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the curtains; ", "and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and laid it right across the minister's bedazzled eyes. ", "There he was, with the pen still between his fingers, and a vast, immeasurable tract of written space behind him! ", "[Illustration]                             XXI. ", "THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY. ", "Betimes in the morning of the day on which the new Governor was to receive his office at the hands of the people, Hester Prynne and little Pearl came into the market-place. ", "It was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in considerable numbers; ", "among whom, likewise, were many rough figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony. ", "On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven years past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth. ", "Not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline; ", "while, again, the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness, and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination. ", "Her face, so long familiar to the towns-people, showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there. ", "It was like a mask; ", "or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman's features; ", "owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester was actually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle. ", "It might be, on this one day, that there was an expression unseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now; ", "unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart, and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien. ", "Such a spiritual seer might have conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through seven miserable years as a necessity, a penance, and something which it was a stern religion to endure, she now, for one last time more, encountered it freely and voluntarily, in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph. \" ", "Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!\"-the people's victim and life-long bond-slave, as they fancied her, might say to them. ", "Yet a little while, and she will be beyond your reach! ", "A few hours longer, and the deep, mysterious ocean will quench and hide forever the symbol which ye have caused to burn upon her bosom!\" ", "Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester's mind, at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being. ", "Might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored? ", "The wine of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be indeed rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden beaker; ", "or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with a cordial of intensest potency. ", "Pearl was decked out with airy gayety. ", "It would have been impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the shape of gloomy gray; ", "or that a fancy, at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the child's apparel, was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult, in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to Hester's simple robe. ", "The dress, so proper was it to little Pearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character, no more to be separated from her than the many-hued brilliancy from a butterfly's wing, or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower. ", "As with these, so with the child; ", "her garb was all of one idea with her nature. ", "On this eventful day, moreover, there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood, resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed. ", "Children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them; ", "always, especially, a sense of any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, in domestic circumstances; ", "and therefore Pearl, who was the gem on her mother's unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of her spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of Hester's brow. ", "This effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement, rather than walk by her mother's side. ", "She broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music. ", "When they reached the market-place, she became still more restless, on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot; ", "for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town's business. ", "\"Why, what is this, mother?\" cried she. ", "Wherefore have all the people left their work to-day? ", "Is it a play-day for the whole world? ", "See, there is the blacksmith! ", "He has washed his sooty face, and put on his Sabbath-day clothes, and looks as if he would gladly be merry, if any kind body would only teach him how! ", "And there is Master Brackett, the old jailer, nodding and smiling at me. ", "Why does he do so, mother?\" ", "\"He remembers thee a little babe, my child,\" answered Hester. ", "\"He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,-the black, grim, ugly-eyed old man!\" said Pearl. ", "\" He may nod at thee, if he will; ", "for thou art clad in gray, and wearest the scarlet letter. ", "But see, mother, how many faces of strange people, and Indians among them, and sailors! ", "What have they all come to do, here in the market-place?\" ", "\"They wait to see the procession pass,\" said Hester. ", "For the Governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers, and all the great people and good people, with the music and the soldiers marching before them.\" ", "\"And will the minister be there?\" asked Pearl. ", "And will he hold out both his hands to me, as when thou ledst me to him from the brook-side?\" ", "\"He will be there, child,\" answered her mother. ", "\" But he will not greet thee to-day; ", "nor must thou greet him.\" ", "\"What a strange, sad man is he!\" said the child, as if speaking partly to herself. ", "\" In the dark night-time he calls us to him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder. ", "And in the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! ", "And he kisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! ", "But here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us not; ", "nor must we know him! ", "A strange, sad man is he, with his hand always over his heart!\" ", "\"Be quiet, Pearl! ", "Thou understandest not these things,\" said her mother. ", "\" Think not now of the minister, but look about thee, and see how cheery is everybody's face to-day. ", "The children have come from their schools, and the grown people from their workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy. ", "For, to-day, a new man is beginning to rule over them; ", "and so-as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gathered-they make merry and rejoice; ", "as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world! ", "\" It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people. ", "Into this festal season of the year-as it already was, and continued to be during the greater part of two centuries-the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; ", "thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that, for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction. ", "But we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age. ", "The persons now in the market-place of Boston had not been born to an inheritance of Puritanic gloom. ", "They were native Englishmen, whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the Elizabethan epoch; ", "a time when the life of England, viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been as stately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. ", "Had they followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets, pageantries, and processions. ", "Nor would it have been impracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were, a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state, which a nation, at such festivals, puts on. ", "There was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced. ", "The dim reflection of a remembered splendor, a colorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old London,-we will not say at a royal coronation, but at a Lord Mayor's show,-might be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted, with reference to the annual installation of magistrates. ", "The fathers and founders of the commonwealth-the statesman, the priest, and the soldier-deemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was looked upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence. ", "All came forth, to move in procession before the people's eye, and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed. ", "Then, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged, in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of the same piece and material with their religion. ", "Here, it is true, were none of the applicances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the England of Elizabeth's time, or that of James;-no rude shows of a theatrical kind; ", "no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor gleeman, with an ape dancing to his music; ", "no juggler, with his tricks of mimic witchcraft; ", "no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude with jests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective, by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy. ", "All such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline of law, but by the general sentiment which gives law its vitality. ", "Not the less, however, the great, honest face of the people smiled, grimly, perhaps, but widely too. ", "Nor were sports wanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and shared in, long ago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of England; ", "and ", "which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil, for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them. ", "Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of Cornwall and Devonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place; ", "in one corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff; ", "and-what attracted most interest of all-on the platform of the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword. ", "But, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle, who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places. ", "It may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment, and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry, in their day,) that they would compare favorably, in point of holiday keeping, with their descendants, even at so long an interval as ourselves. ", "Their immediate posterity, the generation next to the early emigrants, wore the blackest shade of Puritanism, and so darkened the national visage with it, that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up. ", "We have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gayety. ", "The picture of human life in the market-place, though its general tint was the sad gray, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue. ", "A party of Indians-in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear-stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. ", "Nor, wild as were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the scene. ", "This distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners,-a part of the crew of the vessel from the Spanish Main,-who had come ashore to see the humors of Election Day. ", "They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened faces, and an immensity of beard; ", "their wide, short trousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife, and, in some instances, a sword. ", "From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf gleamed eyes which, even in good-nature and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. ", "They transgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behavior that were binding on all others; ", "smoking tobacco under the beadle's very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling; ", "and quaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine or aqua-vit\u00e6 from pocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them. ", "It remarkably characterized the incomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a license was allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element. ", "The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own. ", "There could be little doubt, for instance, that this very ship's crew, though no unfavorable specimens of the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice. ", "But the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and foamed, very much at its own will, or subject only to the tempestuous wind, with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law. ", "The buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling, and become at once, if he chose, a man of probity and piety on land; ", "nor, even in the full career of his reckless life, was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic, or casually associate. ", "Thus, the Puritan elders, in their black cloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled not unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men; ", "and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion, when so reputable a citizen as old Roger Chillingworth, the physician, was seen to enter the market-place, in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel. ", "The latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, so far as apparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude. ", "He wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold-lace on his hat, which was also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted with a feather. ", "There was a sword at his side, and a sword-cut on his forehead, which, by the arrangement of his hair, he seemed anxious rather to display than hide. ", "A landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face, and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without undergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably incurring fine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks. ", "As regarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked upon as pertaining to the character, as to a fish his glistening scales. ", "After parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol ship strolled idly through the market-place; ", "until, happening to approach the spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognize, and did not hesitate to address her. ", "As was usually the case wherever Hester stood, a small vacant area-a sort of magic circle-had formed itself about her, into which, though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance, none ventured, or felt disposed to intrude. ", "It was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer; ", "partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive, though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her fellow-creatures. ", "Now, if never before, it answered a good purpose, by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard; ", "and so changed was Hester Prynne's repute before the public, that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself. ", "So, mistress,\" said the mariner, \"I must bid the steward make ready one more berth than you bargained for! ", "No fear of scurvy or ship-fever, this voyage! ", "What with the ship's surgeon and this other doctor, our only danger will be from drug or pill; ", "more by token, as there is a lot of apothecary's stuff aboard, which I traded for with a Spanish vessel.\" ", "\"What mean you?\" inquired Hester, startled more than she permitted to appear. ", "\" Have you another passenger?\" ", "\"Why, know you not,\" cried the shipmaster, \"that this physician here-Chillingworth, he calls himself-is minded to try my cabin-fare with you? ", "Ay, ay, you must have known it; ", "for he tells me he is of your party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of,-he that is in peril from these sour old Puritan rulers!\" ", "[Illustration: ", "Chillingworth,-\"Smile with a sinister meaning\"]  \"They know each other well, indeed,\" replied Hester, with a mien of calmness, though in the utmost consternation. ", "\" They have long dwelt together. ", "Nothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne. ", "But, at that instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself, standing in the remotest corner of the market-place, and smiling on her; ", "a smile which-across the wide and bustling square, and through all the talk and laughter, and various thoughts, moods, and interests of the crowd-conveyed secret and fearful meaning. ", "[Illustration]                             XXII. ", "THE PROCESSION. ", "Before Hester Prynne could call together her thoughts, and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs, the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street. ", "It denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens, on its way towards the meeting-house; ", "where, in compliance with a custom thus early established, and ever since observed, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver an Election Sermon. ", "[Illustration: ", "New England Worthies] ", "Soon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow and stately march, turning a corner, and making its way across the market-place. ", "First came the music. ", "It comprised a variety of instruments, perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another, and played with no great skill; ", "but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitude,-that of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye. ", "Little Pearl at first clapped her hands, but then lost, for an instant, the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning; ", "she gazed silently, and seemed to be borne upward, like a floating sea-bird, on the long heaves and swells of sound. ", "But she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armor of the military company, which followed after the music, and formed the honorary escort of the procession. ", "This body of soldiery-which still sustains a corporate existence, and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honorable fame-was composed of no mercenary materials. ", "Its ranks were filled with gentlemen, who felt the stirrings of martial impulse, and sought to establish a kind of College of Arms, where, as in an association of Knights Templars, they might learn the science, and, so far as peaceful exercise would teach them, the practices of war. ", "The high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company. ", "Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low Countries and on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. ", "The entire array, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with plumage nodding over their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal. ", "And yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediately behind the military escort, were better worth a thoughtful observer's eye. ", "Even in outward demeanor, they showed a stamp of majesty that made the warrior's haughty stride look vulgar, if not absurd. ", "It was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now, but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more. ", "The people possessed, by hereditary right, the quality of reverence; ", "which, in their descendants, if it survive at all, exists in smaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force, in the selection and estimate of public men. ", "The change may be for good or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. ", "In that old day, the English settler on these rude shores-having left king, nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while still the faculty and necessity of reverence were strong in him-bestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of age; ", "on long-tried integrity; ", "on solid wisdom and sad-colored experience; ", "on endowments of that grave and weighty order which gives the idea of permanence, and comes under the general definition of respectability. ", "These primitive statesmen, therefore,-Bradstreet, Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their compeers,-who were elevated to power by the early choice of the people, seem to have been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. ", "They had fortitude and self-reliance, and, in time of difficulty or peril, stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide. ", "The traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates. ", "So far as a demeanor of natural authority was concerned, the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the House of Peers, or made the Privy Council of the sovereign. ", "Next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently distinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourse of the anniversary was expected. ", "His was the profession, at that era, in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life; ", "for-leaving a higher motive out of the question-it offered inducements powerful enough, in the almost worshipping respect of the community, to win the most aspiring ambition into its service. ", "Even political power-as in the case of Increase Mather-was within the grasp of a successful priest. ", "It was the observation of those who beheld him now, that never, since Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New England shore, had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession. ", "There was no feebleness of step, as at other times; ", "his frame was not bent; ", "nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart. ", "Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemed not of the body. ", "It might be spiritual, and imparted to him by angelic ministrations. ", "It might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial, which is distilled only in the furnace-glow of earnest and long-continued thought. ", "Or, perchance, his sensitive temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music, that swelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending wave. ", "Nevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it might be questioned whether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the music. ", "There was his body, moving onward, and with an unaccustomed force. ", "But where was his mind? ", "Far and deep in its own region, busying itself, with preternatural activity, to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence; ", "and so he saw nothing, heard nothing, knew nothing, of what was around him; ", "but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame, and carried it along, unconscious of the burden, and converting it to spirit like itself. ", "Men of uncommon intellect, who have grown morbid, possess this occasional power of mighty effort, into which they throw the life of many days, and then are lifeless for as many more. ", "Hester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman, felt a dreary influence come over her, but ", "wherefore or whence ", "she knew not; ", "unless that he seemed so remote from her own sphere, and utterly beyond her reach. ", "One glance of recognition, she had imagined, must needs pass between them. ", "She thought of the dim forest, with its little dell of solitude, and love, and anguish, and the mossy tree-trunk, where, sitting hand in hand, they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook. ", "How deeply had they known each other then! ", "And was this the man? ", "She hardly knew him now! ", "He, moving proudly past, enveloped, as it were, in the rich music, with the procession of majestic and venerable fathers; ", "he, so unattainable in his worldly position, and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizing thoughts, through which she now beheld him! ", "Her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that, vividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself. ", "And thus much of woman was there in Hester, that she could scarcely forgive him,-least of all now, when the heavy footstep of their approaching Fate might be heard, nearer, nearer, nearer!-for being able so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world; ", "while she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold hands, and found him not. ", "Pearl either saw and responded to her mother's feelings, or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the minister. ", "While the procession passed, the child was uneasy, fluttering up and down, like a bird on the point of taking flight. ", "When the whole had gone by, she looked up into Hester's face. ", "\"Mother,\" said she, \"was that the same minister that kissed me by the brook?\" ", "\"Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!\" whispered her mother. ", "\" We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.\" ", "\"I could not be sure that it was he; ", "so strange he looked,\" continued the child. \" ", "Else I would have run to him, and bid him kiss me now, before all the people; ", "even as he did yonder among the dark old trees. ", "What would the minister have said, mother? ", "Would he have clapped his hand over his heart, and scowled on me, and bid me be gone?\" ", "\"What should he say, Pearl,\" answered Hester, \"save that it was no time to kiss, and that kisses are not to be given in the market-place? ", "Well for thee, foolish child, that thou didst not speak to him!\" ", "Another shade of the same sentiment, in reference to Mr. Dimmesdale, was expressed by a person whose eccentricities-or insanity, as we should term it-led her to do what few of the towns-people would have ventured on; ", "to begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter, in public. ", "It was Mistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence, with a triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, and a gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession. ", "As this ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently cost her no less a price than her life) of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy that were continually going forward, the crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touch of her garment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds. ", "Seen in conjunction with Hester Prynne,-kindly as so many now felt towards the latter,-the dread inspired by Mistress Hibbins was doubled, and caused a general movement from that part of the market-place in which the two women stood. ", "\"Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!\" ", "whispered the old lady, confidentially, to Hester. ", "Yonder divine man! ", "That saint on earth, as the people uphold him to be, and as-I must needs say-he really looks! ", "Who, now, that saw him pass in the procession, would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his study,-chewing a Hebrew text of Scripture in his mouth, I warrant,-to take an airing in the forest! ", "Aha! ", "we know what that means, Hester Prynne! ", "But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe him the same man. ", "Many a church-member saw I, walking behind the music, that has danced in the same measure with me, when Somebody was fiddler, and, it might be, an Indian powwow or a Lapland wizard changing hands with us! ", "That is but a trifle, when a woman knows the world. ", "But this minister! ", "Couldst thou surely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man that encountered thee on the forest-path?\" ", "\"Madam, I know not of what you speak,\" answered Hester Prynne, feeling Mistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; ", "yet strangely startled and awe-stricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal connection between so many persons (herself among them) and the Evil One. ", "\" It is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the Word, like the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale!\" ", "\"Fie, woman, fie!\" cried the old lady, shaking her finger at Hester. ", "Dost thou think I have been to the forest so many times, and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there? ", "Yea; ", "though no leaf of the wild garlands, which they wore while they danced, be left in their hair! ", "I know thee, Hester; ", "for I behold the token. ", "We may all see it in the sunshine; ", "and it glows like a red flame in the dark. ", "Thou wearest it openly; ", "so there need be no question about that. ", "But this minister! ", "Let me tell thee, in thine ear! ", "When the Black Man sees one of his own servants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world! ", "What is it that the minister seeks to hide, with his hand always over his heart? ", "Ha, Hester Prynne!\" ", "\"What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?\" ", "eagerly asked little Pearl. \" ", "Hast thou seen it?\" ", "\"No matter, darling!\" responded Mistress Hibbins, making Pearl a profound reverence. ", "\" Thou thyself wilt see it, one time or another. ", "They say, child, thou art of the lineage of the Prince of the Air! ", "Wilt thou ride with me, some fine night, to see thy father? ", "Then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart!\" ", "Laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her, the weird old gentlewoman took her departure. ", "By this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse. ", "An irresistible feeling kept Hester near the spot. ", "As the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor, she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory. ", "It was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears, in the shape of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of the minister's very peculiar voice. ", "This vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; ", "insomuch that a listener, comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence. ", "Like all other music, it breathed passion and pathos, and emotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the human heart, wherever educated. ", "Muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church-walls, Hester Prynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized so intimately, that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her, entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. ", "These, perhaps, if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium, and have clogged the spiritual sense. ", "Now she caught the low undertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; ", "then ascended with it, as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power, until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur. ", "And yet, majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was forever in it an essential character of plaintiveness. ", "A loud or low expression of anguish,-the whisper, or the shriek, as it might be conceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility in every bosom! ", "At times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a desolate silence. ", "But even when the minister's voice grew high and commanding,-when it gushed irrepressibly upward,-when it assumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself in the open air,-still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the purpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. ", "What was it? ", "The complaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind; ", "beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,-at every moment,-in each accent,-and never in vain! ", "It was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power. ", "During all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of the scaffold. ", "If the minister's voice had not kept her there, there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy. ", "There was a sense within her,-too ill-defined to be made a thought, but weighing heavily on her mind,-that her whole orb of life, both before and after, was connected with this spot, as with the one point that gave it unity. ", "Little Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother's side, and was playing at her own will about the market-place. ", "She made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray; ", "even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage, by darting to and fro, half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves. ", "She had an undulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and irregular movement. ", "It indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit, which to-day was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance, because it was played upon and vibrated with her mother's disquietude. ", "Whenever Pearl saw anything to excite her ever-active and wandering curiosity, she flew thitherward and, as we might say, seized upon that man or thing as her own property, so far as she desired it; ", "but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital. ", "The Puritans looked on, and, if they smiled, were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure, and sparkled with its activity. ", "She ran and looked the wild Indian in the face; ", "and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own. ", "Thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the Indians were of the land; ", "and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a flake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a little maid, and were gifted with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashes beneath the prow in the night-time. ", "One of these seafaring men-the shipmaster, indeed, who had spoken to Hester Prynne-was so smitten with Pearl's aspect, that he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. ", "Finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it, and threw it to the child. ", "Pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist, with such happy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, and it was difficult to imagine her without it. \" ", "Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,\" said the seaman. ", "\"Wilt thou carry her a message from me?\" ", "\"If the message pleases me, I will,\" answered Pearl. \" ", "Then tell her,\" rejoined he, \"that I spake again with the black-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him. ", "So let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee. ", "Wilt thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?\" ", "\"Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!\" cried Pearl, with a naughty smile. ", "\" If thou callest me that ill name, I shall tell him of thee; ", "and he will chase thy ship with a tempest!\" ", "Pursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the child returned to her mother, and communicated what the mariner had said. ", "Hester's strong, calm, steadfastly enduring spirit almost sank, at last, on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom, which-at the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of their labyrinth of misery-showed itself, with an unrelenting smile, right in the midst of their path. ", "With her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the shipmaster's intelligence involved her, she was also subjected to another trial. ", "There were many people present, from the country round about, who had often heard of the scarlet letter, and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumors, but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes. ", "These, after exhausting other modes of amusement, now thronged about Hester Prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness. ", "Unscrupulous as it was, however, it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. ", "At that distance they accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal force of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. ", "The whole gang of sailors, likewise, observing the press of spectators, and learning the purport of the scarlet letter, came and thrust their sunburnt and desperado-looking faces into the ring. ", "Even the Indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man's curiosity, and, gliding through the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes on Hester's bosom; ", "conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people. ", "Lastly the inhabitants of the town (their own interest in this worn-out subject languidly reviving itself, by sympathy with what they saw others feel) lounged idly to the same quarter, and tormented Hester Prynne, perhaps more than all the rest, with their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame. ", "Hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons, who had awaited her forthcoming from the prison-door, seven years ago; ", "all save one, the youngest and only compassionate among them, whose burial-robe she had since made. ", "At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter, it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully, than at any time since the first day she put it on. ", "While Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her forever, the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control. ", "The sainted minister in the church! ", "The woman of the scarlet letter in the market-place! ", "What imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both! ", "[Illustration]                           [Illustration]                            XXIII. ", "THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER. ", "The eloquent voice, on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea, at length came to a pause. ", "There was a momentary silence, profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles. ", "Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed tumult; ", "as if the auditors, released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of another's mind, were returning into themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. ", "In a moment more, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church. ", "Now that there was an end, they needed other breath, more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame, and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought. ", "In the open air their rapture broke into speech. ", "The street and the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of the minister. ", "His hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear. ", "According to their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; ", "nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his. ", "Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience. ", "His subject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deity and the communities of mankind, with a special reference to the New England which they were here planting in the wilderness. ", "And, as he drew towards the close, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him, constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of Israel were constrained; ", "only with this difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the Lord. ", "But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse, there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away. ", "Yes; ", "their minister whom they so loved-and who so loved them all, that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh-had the foreboding of untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in their tears! ", "This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; ", "it was as if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instant,-at once a shadow and a splendor,-and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them. ", "Thus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale-as to most men, in their various spheres, though seldom recognized until they see it far behind them-an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be. ", "He stood, at this moment, on the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the gifts of intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation of whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England's earliest days, when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal. ", "Such was the position which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit, at the close of his Election Sermon. ", "Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast! ", "Now was heard again the clangor of the music, and the measured tramp of the military escort, issuing from the church-door. ", "The procession was to be marshalled thence to the town-hall, where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day. ", "Once more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic fathers was seen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the old and wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midst of them. ", "When they were fairly in the market-place, their presence was greeted by a shout. ", "This-though doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers-was felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears. ", "Each felt the impulse in himself, and, in the same breath, caught it from his neighbor. ", "Within the church, it had hardly been kept down; ", "beneath the sky, it pealed upward to the zenith. ", "There were human beings enough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling, to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; ", "even that mighty swell of many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many. ", "Never, from the soil of New England, had gone up such a shout! ", "Never, on New England soil, had stood the man so honored by his mortal brethren as the preacher! ", "How fared it with him then? ", "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head? ", "So etherealized by spirit as he was, and so apotheosized by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust of earth? ", "As the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them. ", "The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him. ", "How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph! ", "The energy-or say, rather, the inspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that brought its own strength along with it from heaven-was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office. ", "The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late-decaying embers. ", "It seemed hardly the face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue; ", "it was hardly a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervelessly, yet tottered, and did not fall! ", "One of his clerical brethren,-it was the venerable John Wilson,-observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to offer his support. ", "The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled the old man's arm. ", "He still walked onward, if that movement could be so described, which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother's arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. ", "And now, almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold, where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between, Hester Prynne had encountered the world's ignominious stare. ", "There stood Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand! ", "And there was the scarlet letter on her breast! ", "The minister here made a pause; ", "although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved. ", "It summoned him onward,-onward to the festival!-but here he made a pause. ", "Bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious eye upon him. ", "He now left his own place in the procession, and advanced to give assistance; ", "judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale's aspect, that he must otherwise inevitably fall. ", "But there was something in the latter's expression that warned back the magistrate, although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another. ", "The crowd, meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder. ", "This earthly faintness was, in their view, only another phase of the minister's celestial strength; ", "nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes, waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the light of heaven. ", "He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms. \" ", "Hester,\" said he, \"come hither! ", "Come, my little Pearl!\" ", "It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; ", "but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it. ", "The child, with the bird-like motion which was one of her characteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about his knees. ", "Hester Prynne-slowly, as if impelled by inevitable fate, and against her strongest will-likewise drew near, but paused before she reached him. ", "At this instant, old Roger Chillingworth thrust himself through the crowd,-or, perhaps, so dark, disturbed, and evil, was his look, he rose up out of some nether region,-to snatch back his victim from what he sought to do! ", "Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward, and caught the minister by the arm. ", "\"Madman, hold! ", "what is your purpose?\" whispered he. ", "\" Wave back that woman! ", "Cast off this child! ", "All shall be well! ", "Do not blacken your fame, and perish in dishonor! ", "I can yet save you! ", "Would you bring infamy on your sacred profession?\" ", "\"Ha, tempter! ", "Methinks thou art too late!\" answered the minister, encountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. \" ", "Thy power is not what it was! ", "With God's help, I shall escape thee now!\" ", "He again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter. \" ", "Hester Prynne,\" cried he, with a piercing earnestness, \"in the name of Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me grace, at this last moment, to do what-for my own heavy sin and miserable agony-I withheld myself from doing seven years ago, come hither now, and twine thy strength about me! ", "Thy strength, Hester; ", "but let it be guided by the will which God hath granted me! ", "This wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his might!-with all his own might, and the fiend's! ", "Come, Hester, come! ", "Support me up yonder scaffold!\" ", "The crowd was in a tumult. ", "The men of rank and dignity, who stood more immediately around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw,-unable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any other,-that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgment which Providence seemed about to work. ", "They beheld the minister, leaning on Hester's shoulder, and supported by her arm around him, approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; ", "while still the little hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. ", "Old Roger Chillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors, and well entitled, therefore, to be present at its closing scene. \" ", "Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,\" said he, looking darkly at the clergyman, \"there was no one place so secret,-no high place nor lowly place, where thou couldst have escaped me,-save on this very scaffold!\" ", "\"Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!\" answered the minister. ", "Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed, that there was a feeble smile upon his lips. \" ", "Is not this better,\" murmured he, \"than what we dreamed of in the forest?\" ", "\"I know not! ", "I know not!\" ", "she hurriedly replied. \" ", "Better? ", "Yea; ", "so we may both die, and little Pearl die with us!\" ", "\"For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,\" said the minister; ", "\"and God is merciful! ", "Let me now do the will which he hath made plain before my sight. ", "For, Hester, I am a dying man. ", "So let me make haste to take my shame upon me!\" ", "Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of little Pearl's, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers; ", "to the holy ministers, who were his brethren; ", "to the people, whose great heart was thoroughly appalled, yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter-which, if full of sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise-was now to be laid open to them. ", "The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon the clergyman, and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he stood out from all the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal Justice. ", "\"People of New England!\" cried he, with a voice that rose over them, high, solemn, and majestic,-yet had always a tremor through it, and sometimes a shriek, struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and woe,-\"ye, that have loved me!-ye, that have deemed me holy!-behold me here, the one sinner of the world! ", "At last!-at last!-I stand upon the spot where, seven years since, I should have stood; ", "here, with this woman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewith I have crept hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadful moment, from grovelling down upon my face! ", "Lo, the scarlet letter which Hester wears! ", "Ye have all shuddered at it! ", "Wherever her walk hath been,-wherever, so miserably burdened, she may have hoped to find repose,-it hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her. ", "But there stood one in the midst of you, at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered!\" ", "It seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave the remainder of his secret undisclosed. ", "But he fought back the bodily weakness,-and, still more, the faintness of heart,-that was striving for the mastery with him. ", "He threw off all assistance, and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman and the child. ", "\"It was on him!\" ", "he continued, with a kind of fierceness; ", "so determined was he to speak out the whole. \" ", "God's eye beheld it! ", "The angels were forever pointing at it! ", "The Devil knew it well, and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger! ", "But he hid it cunningly from men, and walked among you with the mien of a spirit, mournful, because so pure in a sinful world!-and sad, because he missed his heavenly kindred! ", "Now, at the death-hour, he stands up before you! ", "He bids you look again at Hester's scarlet letter! ", "He tells you, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his own red stigma, is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart! ", "Stand any here that question God's judgment on a sinner? ", "Behold! ", "Behold a dreadful witness of it!\" ", "[Illustration: ", "Shall we not meet again?\" ", "] With a convulsive motion, he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast. ", "It was revealed! ", "But it were irreverent to describe that revelation. ", "For an instant, the gaze of the horror-stricken multitude was concentred on the ghastly miracle; ", "while the minister stood, with a flush of triumph in his face, as one who, in the crisis of acutest pain, had won a victory. ", "Then, down he sank upon the scaffold! ", "Hester partly raised him, and supported his head against her bosom. ", "Old Roger Chillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull countenance, out of which the life seemed to have departed. ", "Thou hast escaped me!\" ", "he repeated more than once. ", "Thou hast escaped me!\" ", "\"May God forgive thee!\" said the minister. ", "\" Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!\" ", "He withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixed them on the woman and the child. ", "\"My little Pearl,\" said he, ", "feebly,-and there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep repose; ", "nay, now that the burden was removed, it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with the child,-\"dear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now? ", "Thou wouldst not, yonder, in the forest! ", "But now thou wilt?\" ", "Pearl kissed his lips. ", "A spell was broken. ", "The great scene of grief, in which the wild infant bore a part, had developed all her sympathies; ", "and as her tears fell upon her father's cheek, they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be a woman in it. ", "Towards her mother, too, Pearl's errand as a messenger of anguish was all fulfilled. \" ", "Hester,\" said the clergyman, \"farewell!\" ", "\"Shall we not meet again?\" whispered she, bending her face down close to his. ", "\" Shall we not spend our immortal life together? ", "Surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, with all this woe! ", "Thou lookest far into eternity, with those bright dying eyes! ", "Then tell me what thou seest?\" ", "\"Hush, Hester, hush!\" said he, with tremulous solemnity. ", "\" The law we broke!-the sin here so awfully revealed!-let these alone be in thy thoughts!

", "Had either of these agonies been wanting, I had been lost forever! ", "Praised be his name! ", "His will be done! ", "Farewell!\" ", "That final word came forth with the minister's expiring breath.

", "After many days, when time sufficed for the people to arrange their thoughts in reference to the foregoing scene, there was more than one account of what had been witnessed on the scaffold. ", "Most of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a SCARLET LETTER-the very semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne-imprinted in the flesh. ", "As regarded its origin, there were various explanations, all of which must necessarily have been conjectural. ", "Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had begun a course of penance,-which he afterwards, in so many futile methods, followed out,-by inflicting a hideous torture on himself. ", "Others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had caused it to appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs. ", "Others, again,-and those best able to appreciate the minister's peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the body,-whispered their belief, that the awful symbol was the effect of the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven's dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. ", "The reader may choose among these theories. ", "We have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of our own brain; ", "where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness. ", "It is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were spectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast, more than on a new-born infant's. ", "Neither, by their report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightest connection, on his part, with the guilt for which Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. ", "According to these highly respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he was dying,-conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angels,-had desired, by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman, to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of man's own righteousness. ", "After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind's spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike. ", "It was to teach them, that the holiest among us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would look aspiringly upward. ", "Without disputing a truth so momentous, we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale's story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a man's friends-and especially a clergyman's-will sometimes uphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained creature of the dust. ", "The authority which we have chiefly followed,-a manuscript of old date, drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals, some of whom had known Hester Prynne, while others had heard the tale from contemporary witnesses,-fully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages. ", "Among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister's miserable experience, we put only this into a sentence:-\"Be true! ", "Be true! ", "Be true! ", "Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred! ", "\" Nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdale's death, in the appearance and demeanor of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. ", "All his strength and energy-all his vital and intellectual force-seemed at once to desert him; ", "insomuch that he positively withered up, shrivelled away, and almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun. ", "This unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge; ", "and when, by its completest triumph and consummation, that evil principle was left with no further material to support it, when, in short, there was no more Devil's work on earth for him to do, it only remained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his Master would find him tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. ", "But, to all these shadowy beings, so long ", "our near acquaintances,-as well Roger Chillingworth as his companions,-we would fain be merciful. ", "It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. ", "Each, in its utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; ", "each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another; ", "each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject. ", "Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seem essentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow. ", "In the spiritual world, the old physician and the minister-mutual victims as they have been-may, unawares, have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love. ", "Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader. ", "At old Roger Chillingworth's decease, (which took place within the year,) and by his last will and testament, of which Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr. Wilson were executors, he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property, both here and in England, to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne. ", "So Pearl-the elf-child,-the demon offspring, as some people, up to that epoch, persisted in considering her,-became the richest heiress of her day, in the New World. ", "Not improbably, this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation; ", "and, had the mother and child remained here, little Pearl, at a marriageable period of life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them all. ", "But, in no long time after the physician's death, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearl along with her. ", "For many years, though a vague report would now and then find its way across the sea,-like a shapeless piece of drift-wood tost ashore, with the initials of a name upon it,-yet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received. ", "The story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend. ", "Its spell, however, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died, and likewise the cottage by the sea-shore, where Hester Prynne had dwelt. ", "Near this latter spot, one afternoon, some children were at play, when they beheld a tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the cottage-door. ", "In all those years it had never once been opened; ", "but either she unlocked it, or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand, or she glided shadow-like through these impediments,-and, at all events, went in. ", "On the threshold she paused,-turned partly round,-for, perchance, the idea of entering all alone, and all so changed, the home of so intense a former life, was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear. ", "But her hesitation was only for an instant, though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast. ", "And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken shame! ", "But where was little Pearl? ", "If still alive, she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood. ", "None knew-nor ever learned, with the fulness of perfect certainty-whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave; ", "or ", "whether her wild, rich nature had been softened and subdued, and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness. ", "But, through the remainder of Hester's life, there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land. ", "Letters came, with armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to English heraldry. ", "In the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as Hester never cared to use, but which only wealth could have purchased, and affection have imagined for her. ", "There were trifles, too, little ornaments, beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must have been wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a fond heart. ", "And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment, with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown to our sober-hued community. ", "In fine, the gossips of that day believed,-and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who made investigations a century later, believed,-and one of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully believes,-that Pearl was not only alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother, and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside. ", "But there was a more real life for Hester Prynne here, in New England, than in that unknown region where Pearl had found a home. ", "Here had been her sin; ", "here, her sorrow; ", "and here was yet to be her penitence. ", "She had returned, therefore, and resumed,-of her own free will, for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed ", "it,-resumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale. ", "Never afterwards did it quit her bosom. ", "But, in the lapse of the toilsome, thoughtful, and self-devoted years that made up Hester's life, the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world's scorn and bitterness, and became a type of something to be sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, yet with reverence too. ", "And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish ends, nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment, people brought all their sorrows and perplexities, and besought her counsel, as one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble. ", "Women, more especially,-in the continually recurring trials of wounded, wasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion,-or with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded, because unvalued and unsought,-came to Hester's cottage, demanding why they were so wretched, and what the remedy! ", "Hester comforted and counselled them as best she might. ", "She assured them, too, of her firm belief, that, at some brighter period, when the world should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven's own time, a new truth would be revealed, in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness. ", "Earlier in life, Hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess, but had long since recognized the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a life-long sorrow. ", "The angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman, indeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful; ", "and wise, moreover, not through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy; ", "and ", "showing how sacred love should make us happy, by the truest test of a life successful to such an end! ", "So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter. ", "And, after many, many years, a new grave was delved, near an old and sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King's Chapel has since been built. ", "It was near that old and sunken grave, yet with a space between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. ", "Yet one tombstone served for both. ", "All around, there were monuments carved with armorial bearings; ", "and on this simple slab of slate-as the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex himself with the purport-there appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon. ", "It bore a device, a herald's wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; ", "so sombre is it, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow: ", "-           \"ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES.\""], "frankenstein": ["Letter 1  _To Mrs. Saville, England._ ", "St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17-.

", "I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking. ", "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. ", "Do you understand this feeling? ", "This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. ", "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. ", "I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; ", "it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. ", "There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. ", "There-for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators-there snow and frost are banished; ", "and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.

", "What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? ", "I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. ", "I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. ", "These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. ", "But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; ", "or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine. ", "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose-a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. ", "This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. ", "I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. ", "You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library. ", "My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. ", "These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life. ", "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. ", "I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; ", "I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. ", "You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. ", "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent. ", "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. ", "I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. ", "I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. ", "I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; ", "I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; ", "I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. ", "Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. ", "I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. ", "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? ", "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. ", "Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! ", "My courage and my resolution is firm; ", "but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.

", "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. ", "This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. ", "A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: ", "I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.

", "Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. ", "He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; ", "but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. ", "My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. ", "He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; ", "but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover. ", "But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. ", "\" What a noble fellow! ", "\" you will exclaim.

", "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. ", "Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. ", "The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.

So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. ", "Last Monday (July 31st) ", "we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. ", "Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. ", "We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather. ", "About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. ", "Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. ", "We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; ", "a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. ", "We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. ", "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. ", "We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; ", "but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. ", "Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention. ", "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. ", "We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. ", "I profited of this time to rest for a few hours. ", "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea. ", "It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. ", "Only one dog remained alive; ", "but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. ", "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. ", "When I appeared on deck the master said, \"Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.\" ", "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. ", "\"Before I come on board your vessel,\" said he, \"will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound? ", "\" You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. ", "I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. ", "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. ", "Good God! ", "Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. ", "His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. ", "I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. ", "We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. ", "We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. ", "As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. ", "By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully. ", "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. ", "When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. ", "I never saw a more interesting creature: ", " his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. ", "But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. ", "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; ", "but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. ", "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle. ", "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\" ", "\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\" ", "\"Yes.\" ", "\"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice. ", "This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the d\u00e6mon, as he called him, had pursued. ", "Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, \"I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; ", "but you are too considerate to make inquiries.\" ", "\"Certainly; ", "it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\" ", "\"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; ", "you have benevolently restored me to life.\" ", "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. ", "I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; ", "but of this I could not judge. ", "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. ", "He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; ", "but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. ", "I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. ", "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. ", "The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. ", "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. ", "For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. ", "He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. ", "I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; ", "yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. ", "I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record. ", "August 13th, 17-.   My affection for my guest increases every day. ", "He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. ", "How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? ", "He is so gentle, yet so wise; ", "his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. ", "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. ", "Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. ", "He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. ", "He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. ", "I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. ", "One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. ", "As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. ", "At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; ", "he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; ", "a groan burst from his heaving breast. ", "I paused; ", "at length he spoke, in broken accents: ", "\"Unhappy man! ", "Do you share my madness? ", "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? ", "Hear me; ", "let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!\" ", "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; ", "but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. ", "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; ", "and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. ", "He asked me the history of my earlier years. ", "The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. ", "I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing. ", "\"I agree with you,\" replied the stranger; ", "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves-such a friend ought to be-do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. ", "I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. ", "You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. ", "But I-I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew. ", "\" As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. ", "But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin. ", "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. ", "The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. ", "Such a man has a double existence: ", " he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures. ", "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? ", "You would not if you saw him. ", "You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; ", "but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. ", "Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. ", "I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; ", "add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. ", "August 19th, 17-.   Yesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. ", "I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. ", "You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; ", "and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. ", "I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; ", "yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. ", "Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. ", "Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; ", "but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; ", "nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed. ", "\" You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. ", "I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. ", "I expressed these feelings in my answer. ", "\"I thank you,\" he replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is useless; ", "my fate is nearly fulfilled. ", "I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. ", "I understand your feeling,\" continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; ", "but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; ", "nothing can alter my destiny; ", "listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.\" ", "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. ", "This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. ", "I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. ", "If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. ", "This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; ", "but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips-with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! ", "Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; ", "his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; ", "I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. ", "Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it-thus! ", "Chapter 1   ", "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. ", "My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. ", "He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. ", "He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; ", "a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. ", "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. ", "One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. ", "This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. ", "Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. ", "My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. ", "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. ", "He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. ", "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. ", "Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. ", "But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. ", "Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. ", "The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; ", "his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. ", "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. ", "But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. ", "She procured plain work; ", "she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. ", "Several months passed in this manner. ", "Her father grew worse; ", "her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; ", "her means of subsistence decreased; ", "and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. ", "This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. ", "He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; ", "and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. ", "Two years after this event Caroline became his wife. ", "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. ", "There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. ", "Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. ", "There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. ", "Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. ", "He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. ", "Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. ", "During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; ", "and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame. ", "From Italy they visited Germany and France. ", "I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. ", "I remained for several years their only child. ", "Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. ", "My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. ", "I was their plaything and their idol, and something better-their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. ", "With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. ", "For a long time I was their only care. ", "My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. ", "When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. ", "Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. ", "This, to my mother, was more than a duty; ", "it was a necessity, a passion-remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved-for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. ", "During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. ", "One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. ", "She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. ", "Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. ", "She appeared of a different stock. ", "The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; ", "this child was thin and very fair. ", "Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. ", "Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. ", "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. ", "She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. ", "Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth. ", "The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: ", "they were better off then. ", "They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.

", "Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. ", "Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; ", "but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. ", "She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; ", "and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home -the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers-she found ample scope for admiration and delight. ", "While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.

", "He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. ", "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. ", "My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. ", "We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. ", "When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love. ", "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; ", "but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. ", "I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. ", "It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; ", "and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world. ", "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. ", "The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; ", "and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. ", "The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. ", "Her sympathy was ours; ", "her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. ", "She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; ", "I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. ", "And Clerval-could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? ", "Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition. ", "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. ", "Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; ", "but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. ", "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; ", "I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. ", "When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; ", "the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. ", "In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. ", "I opened it with apathy; ", "the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. ", "A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. ", "My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, \"Ah! ", "Cornelius Agrippa! ", "My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; ", "it is sad trash. ", "\" If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. ", "It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. ", "But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. ", "When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. ", "I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; ", "they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself. ", "I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. ", "In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. ", "Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. ", "Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit. ", "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. ", "The most learned philosopher knew little more. ", "He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. ", "He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; ", "but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. ", "I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined. ", "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. ", "I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. ", "It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; ", "but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. ", "My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge. ", "Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; ", "but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. ", "Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death! ", "Nor were these my only visions. ", "The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; ", "and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. ", "And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. ", "When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. ", "It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. ", "I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. ", "As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; ", "and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. ", "When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. ", "It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. ", "I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. ", "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. ", "On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. ", "All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; ", "but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. ", "It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. ", "All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. ", "By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. ", "In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration. ", "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. ", "When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life-the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. ", "Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. ", "It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard. ", "It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. ", "Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction. ", "Chapter 3   ", "When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. ", "I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. ", "My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred-an omen, as it were, of my future misery. ", "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; ", "her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. ", "During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. ", "She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. ", "She attended her sickbed; ", "her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper-Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. ", "On the third day my mother sickened; ", "her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. ", "On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. ", "She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. ", "\" My children,\" she said, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. ", "This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. ", "Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. ", "Alas! ", "I regret that I am taken from you; ", "and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? ", "But these are not thoughts befitting me; ", "I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world. ", "\" She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. ", "I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. ", "It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever-that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. ", "These are the reflections of the first days; ", "but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. ", "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? ", "And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? ", "The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; ", "and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. ", "My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; ", "we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. ", "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. ", "I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. ", "It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. ", "I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. ", "I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. ", "She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. ", "She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. ", "She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. ", "Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. ", "She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. ", "The day of my departure at length arrived. ", "Clerval spent the last evening with us. ", "He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. ", "His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. ", "Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. ", "He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. ", "We sat late. ", "We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word \"Farewell!\" ", "It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; ", "but when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there-my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. ", "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. ", "I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure-I was now alone. ", "In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. ", "My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. ", "I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; ", "these were \"old familiar faces,\" but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. ", "Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; ", "but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. ", "I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. ", "I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. ", "Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. ", "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. ", "At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. ", "I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. ", "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. ", "Chance-or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door-led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. ", "He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. ", "He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. ", "I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. ", "The professor stared. \" ", "Have you,\" he said, \"really spent your time in studying such nonsense?\" ", "I replied in the affirmative. ", "\"Every minute,\" continued M. Krempe with warmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. ", "You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. ", "Good God! ", "In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? ", "I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. ", "My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.\" ", "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted. ", "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; ", "but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. ", "M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; ", "the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. ", "In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. ", "As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. ", "With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. ", "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. ", "It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; ", "such views, although futile, were grand; ", "but now the scene was changed. ", "The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. ", "I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. ", "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. ", "But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. ", "And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town. ", "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. ", "This professor was very unlike his colleague. ", "He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; ", "a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. ", "His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. ", "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. ", "He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. ", "After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: ", "\"The ancient teachers of this science,\" said he, \"promised impossibilities and performed nothing. ", "The modern masters promise very little; ", "they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. ", "They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. ", "They ascend into the heavens; ", "they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. ", "They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; ", "they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. ", "Such were the professor's words-rather let me say such the words of the fate-enounced to destroy me. ", "As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; ", "one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; ", "chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. ", "So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein-more, far more, will I achieve; ", "treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. ", "I closed not my eyes that night. ", "My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; ", "I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. ", "By degrees, after the morning's dawn, sleep came. ", "I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream. ", "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. ", "On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. ", "His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. ", "I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. ", "He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. ", "He said that \"These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. ", "They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. ", "The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. ", "\" I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; ", "I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. ", "I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. ", "\"I am happy,\" said M. Waldman, \"to have gained a disciple; ", "and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. ", "Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; ", "it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; ", "but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. ", "A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. ", "If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.\" ", "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. ", "He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave. ", "Thus ended a day memorable to me; ", "it decided my future destiny. ", "Chapter 4   ", "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. ", "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. ", "I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. ", "In M. Waldman I found a true friend. ", "His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. ", "In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. ", "My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; ", "it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory. ", "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. ", "My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. ", "Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. ", "Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. ", "None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. ", "In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; ", "but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. ", "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; ", "and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. ", "When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay. ", "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. ", "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? ", "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; ", "yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. ", "I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. ", "Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. ", "To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. ", "I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; ", "I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. ", "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. ", "I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. ", "Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. ", "Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. ", "My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. ", "I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; ", "I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; ", "I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. ", "I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me-a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret. ", "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. ", "The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. ", "Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. ", "After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; ", "nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter. ", "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. ", "After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. ", "But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. ", "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. ", "Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: ", " the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. ", "I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light. ", "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; ", "that cannot be; ", "listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. ", "I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. ", "Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. ", "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. ", "Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. ", "I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; ", "but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. ", "The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. ", "I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; ", "my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. ", "Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. ", "It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. ", "As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. ", "After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began. ", "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. ", "Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. ", "A new species would bless me as its creator and source; ", "many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. ", "No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. ", "Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. ", "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. ", "My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. ", "Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; ", "yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. ", "One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; ", "and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. ", "Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? ", "My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; ", "but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; ", "I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. ", "It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. ", "I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. ", "In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; ", "my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. ", "The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; ", "and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion. ", "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. ", "It was a most beautiful season; ", "never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. ", "And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. ", "I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: ", "\"I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. ", "You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected. ", "\" I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. ", "I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed. ", "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. ", "A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. ", "I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. ", "If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. ", "If this rule were always observed; ", "if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, C\u00e6sar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed. ", "But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed. ", "My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. ", "Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; ", "but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves-sights which before always yielded me supreme delight-so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. ", "The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. ", "But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. ", "Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; ", "the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. ", "Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; ", "the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: ", "my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; ", "and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete. ", "Chapter 5   ", "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. ", "With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. ", "It was already one in the morning; ", "the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; ", "it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. ", "How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? ", "His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. ", "Beautiful! ", "Great God! ", "His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; ", "his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; ", "his teeth of a pearly whiteness; ", "but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. ", "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. ", "I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. ", "For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. ", "I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; ", "but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. ", "Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. ", "At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. ", "But it was in vain; ", "I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. ", "I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. ", "Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; ", "her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; ", "a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. ", "I started from my sleep with horror; ", "a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; ", "when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch-the miserable monster whom I had created. ", "He held up the curtain of the bed; ", "and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. ", "His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. ", "He might have spoken, but I did not hear; ", "one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. ", "I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life. ", "Oh! ", "No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. ", "A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. ", "I had gazed on him while unfinished; ", "he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived. ", "I passed the night wretchedly. ", "Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; ", "at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. ", "Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; ", "dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; ", "and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete! ", "Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. ", "The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. ", "I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. ", "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. ", "I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. ", "My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: ", "     Like one who, on a lonely road,   Doth walk in fear and dread,   And, having once turned round, walks on,   And turns no more his head; ", "  Because he knows a frightful fiend ", "   ", "Doth close behind him tread. ", "[Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner.\"] ", "Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped. ", "Here I paused, I knew not why; ", "but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. ", "As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; ", "it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. ", "\" My dear Frankenstein,\" exclaimed he, \"how glad I am to see you! ", "How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting! ", "\" Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; ", "his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. ", "I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; ", "I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. ", "I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. ", "Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. ", "\" You may easily believe,\" said he, \"how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; ", "and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ", "'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.' ", "But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.\" ", "\"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; ", "but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\" ", "\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. ", "By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. ", "But, my dear Frankenstein,\" continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, \"I did not before remark how very ill you appear; ", "so thin and pale; ", "you look as if you had been watching for several nights.\" ", "\"You have guessed right; ", "I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; ", "but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free. ", "\" I trembled excessively; ", "I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. ", "I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. ", "I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. ", "I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. ", "Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. ", "My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. ", "I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. ", "I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; ", "but nothing appeared. ", "I stepped fearfully in: ", "the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. ", "I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval. ", "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; ", "but I was unable to contain myself. ", "It was not joy only that possessed me; ", "I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. ", "I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; ", "I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. ", "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him. ", "\"My dear Victor,\" cried he, \"what, for God's sake, is the matter? ", "Do not laugh in that manner. ", "How ill you are! ", "What is the cause of all this?\" ", "\"Do not ask me,\" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; ", "\"_he_ can tell. ", "Oh, save me! ", "Save me!\" ", "I imagined that the monster seized me; ", "I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit. ", "Poor Clerval! ", "What must have been his feelings? ", "A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. ", "But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time. ", "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. ", "During all that time Henry was my only nurse. ", "I afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. ", "He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; ", "and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them. ", "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. ", "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. ", "Doubtless my words surprised Henry; ", "he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event. ", "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. ", "I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. ", "It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. ", "I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; ", "my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion. \" ", "Dearest Clerval,\" exclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are to me. ", "This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. ", "How shall I ever repay you? ", "I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.\" ", "\"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; ", "and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?\" ", "I trembled. ", "One subject! ", "What could it be? ", "Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think? ", "Compose yourself,\" said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \"I will not mention it if it agitates you; ", "but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. ", "They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.\" ", "\"Is that all, my dear Henry? ", "How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?\" ", "\"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; ", "it is from your cousin, I believe. ", "\" Chapter 6   ", "Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. ", "It was from my own Elizabeth: ", "\"My dearest Cousin,  \"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. ", "You are forbidden to write-to hold a pen; ", "yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. ", "For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. ", "I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! ", "I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. ", "Yet that is over now: ", "Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. ", "I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting. ", "\"Get well-and return to us. ", "You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. ", "Your father's health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; ", "and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. ", "How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! ", "He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. ", "He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us. ", "My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. ", "He looks upon study as an odious fetter; ", "his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. ", "I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected. ", "\"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. ", "The blue lake and snow-clad mountains-they never change; ", "and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. ", "My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. ", "Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. ", "Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? ", "Probably you do not; ", "I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. ", "Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. ", "This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. ", "My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. ", "The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. ", "Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; ", "and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. ", "A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. ", "Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. ", "Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; ", "and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica-she looked so frank-hearted and happy. ", "My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. ", "This benefit was fully repaid; ", "Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: ", "I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. ", "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. ", "She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her. ", "\"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. ", "Poor Justine was very ill; ", "but other trials were reserved for her. ", "\"One by one, her brothers and sister died; ", "and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. ", "The conscience of the woman was troubled ", "she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. ", "She was a Roman Catholic; ", "and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. ", "Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. ", "Poor girl! ", "She wept when she quitted our house; ", "she was much altered since the death of my aunt; ", "grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. ", "Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety. ", "The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. ", "She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. ", "Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. ", "She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. ", "Justine has just returned to us; ", "and I assure you I love her tenderly. ", "She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; ", "as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt. ", "\"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. ", "I wish you could see him; ", "he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. ", "When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. ", "He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. ", "\"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. ", "The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. ", "Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. ", "Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. ", "But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. ", "She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; ", "but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody. ", "\"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; ", "but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. ", "Write, dearest Victor,-one line-one word will be a blessing to us. ", "Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; ", "we are sincerely grateful. ", "Adieu! ", "my cousin; ", "take care of yourself; ", "and, I entreat you, write! \" ", "Elizabeth Lavenza. \" ", "Geneva, March 18th, 17-.\"    \"Dear, dear Elizabeth! ", "I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: ", "\"I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel. ", "\" I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; ", "but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. ", "In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. ", "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. ", "In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. ", "Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. ", "When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. ", "Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. ", "He had also changed my apartment; ", "for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. ", "But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. ", "M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. ", "He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; ", "but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. ", "What could I do? ", "He meant to please, and he tormented me. ", "I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. ", "I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. ", "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; ", "and the conversation took a more general turn. ", "I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. ", "I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; ", "and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. ", "M. Krempe was not equally docile; ", "and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. ", "\" D-n the fellow!\" cried he; ", "\"why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. ", "Ay, stare if you please; ", "but it is nevertheless true. ", "A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; ", "and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.-Ay, ay,\" continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \"M. Frankenstein is modest; ", "an excellent quality in a young man. ", "Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M.

", "At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; ", "but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. ", "I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. ", "I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. ", "How altered every thing might be during that time! ", "One sudden and desolating change had taken place; ", "but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. ", "Fear overcame me; ", "I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. ", "I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. ", "I contemplated the lake: ", "the waters were placid; ", "all around was calm; ", "and the snowy mountains, \"the palaces of nature,\" were not changed. ", "By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva. ", "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. ", "I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. ", "I wept like a child. ", "Dear mountains! ", "my own beautiful lake! ", "how do you welcome your wanderer? ", "Your summits are clear; ", "the sky and lake are blue and placid. ", "Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness? ", "\" I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; ", "but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. ", "My country, my beloved country! ", "who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake! ", "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. ", "Night also closed around; ", "and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. ", "The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. ", "Alas! ", "I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. ", "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; ", "the gates of the town were already shut; ", "and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. ", "The sky was serene; ", "and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. ", "As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. ", "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. ", "The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. ", "It advanced; ", "the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. ", "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. ", "It was echoed from Sal\u00eave, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; ", "vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; ", "then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. ", "The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. ", "The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop\u00eat. ", "Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; ", "and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the M\u00f4le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. ", "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. ", "This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; ", "I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear angel! ", "this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!\" ", "As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; ", "I stood fixed, gazing intently: ", "I could not be mistaken. ", "A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; ", "its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy d\u00e6mon, to whom I had given life. ", "What did he there? ", "Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? ", "No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; ", "my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. ", "The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. ", "Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. _ ", "He_ was the murderer! ", "I could not doubt it. ", "The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. ", "I thought of pursuing the devil; ", "but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal\u00eave, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. ", "He soon reached the summit, and disappeared. ", "I remained motionless. ", "The thunder ceased; ", "but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. ", "I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: ", "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; ", "the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; ", "its departure. ", "Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; ", "and was this his first crime? ", "Alas! ", "I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; ", "had he not murdered my brother? ", "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. ", "But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; ", "my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. ", "I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me. ", "Day dawned; ", "and I directed my steps towards the town. ", "The gates were open, and I hastened to my father's house. ", "My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. ", "But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. ", "A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. ", "I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. ", "I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. ", "Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. ", "And then of what use would be pursuit? ", "Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Sal\u00eave? ", "These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent. ", "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. ", "I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising. ", "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. ", "Beloved and venerable parent! ", "He still remained to me. ", "I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. ", "It was an historical subject, painted at my father's desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. ", "Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; ", "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. ", "Below this picture was a miniature of William; ", "and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. ", "While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: ", "he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: ", "\"Welcome, my dearest Victor,\" said he. ", "Ah! ", "I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. ", "You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; ", "yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; ", "and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.-Poor William! ", "he was our darling and our pride!\" ", "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; ", "a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. ", "Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; ", "the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. ", "I tried to calm Ernest; ", "I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin. ", "\"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"requires consolation; ", "she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. ", "But since the murderer has been discovered-\"  \"The murderer discovered! ", "Good God! ", "how can that be? ", "who could attempt to pursue him? ", "It is impossible; ", "one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. ", "I saw him too; ", "he was free last night!\" ", "\"I do not know what you mean,\" replied my brother, in accents of wonder, \"but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. ", "No one would believe it at first; ", "and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. ", "Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?\" ", "\"Justine Moritz! ", "Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? ", "But it is wrongfully; ", "every one knows that; ", "no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\" ", "\"No one did at first; ", "but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; ", "and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. ", "But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.\" ", "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. ", "During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. ", "The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; ", "and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. ", "On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. ", "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; ", "and I replied earnestly, \"You are all mistaken; ", "I know the murderer. ", "Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent. ", "\" At that instant my father entered. ", "I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; ", "and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \"Good God, papa! ", "Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\" ", "\"We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father, \"for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.\" ", "\"My dear father, you are mistaken; ", "Justine is innocent.\" ", "\"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. ", "She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted. ", "This speech calmed me. ", "I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. ", "I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. ", "My tale was not one to announce publicly; ", "its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. ", "Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world? ", "We were soon joined by Elizabeth. ", "Time had altered her since I last beheld her; ", "it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. ", "There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. ", "She welcomed me with the greatest affection. ", "Your arrival, my dear cousin,\" said she, \"fills me with hope. ", "You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. ", "Alas! ", "who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? ", "I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. ", "Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; ", "we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. ", "If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. ", "But she will not, I am sure she will not; ", "and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.\" ", "\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I, \"and that shall be proved; ", "fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.\" ", "\"How kind and generous you are! ", "every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: ", " and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\" ", "She wept. ", "\"Dearest niece,\" said my father, \"dry your tears. ", "If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\" ", "Chapter 8   ", "We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence. ", "My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. ", "During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. ", "It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: ", " one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. ", "Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; ", "now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! ", "A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me. ", "The appearance of Justine was calm. ", "She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. ", "Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. ", "She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; ", "and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. ", "When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. ", "A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. ", "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. ", "Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. ", "She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. ", "The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. ", "She returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. ", "When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. ", "The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; ", "and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court. ", "Justine was called on for her defence. ", "As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. ", "Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. ", "Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. ", "God knows,\" she said, \"how entirely I am innocent. ", "But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; ", "I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.\" ", "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Ch\u00eane, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. ", "On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. ", "She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. ", "Most of the night she spent here watching; ", "towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; ", "some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. ", "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. ", "If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. ", "That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. ", "Concerning the picture she could give no account. ", "\"I know,\" continued the unhappy victim, \"how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; ", "and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. ", "But here also I am checked. ", "I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. ", "Did the murderer place it there? ", "I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; ", "or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? ", "\"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. ", "I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence. ", "\" Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; ", "but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. ", "Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court. ", "\"I am,\" said she, \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. ", "It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. ", "I am well acquainted with the accused. ", "I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. ", "During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. ", "She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. ", "She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. ", "For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. ", "She had no temptation for such an action; ", "as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her. ", "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.

", "I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. ", "Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.

", "The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me. ", "Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. ", "It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. ", "My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. ", "I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. ", "Six years had passed since then: ", "I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. ", "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. ", "I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. ", "The weather was fine; ", "it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. ", "The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. ", "The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence-and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. ", "Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. ", "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. ", "But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings. ", "I passed the bridge of P\u00e9lissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. ", "Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. ", "This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. ", "The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. ", "Immense glaciers approached the road; ", "I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. ", "Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its tremendous _d\u00f4me_ overlooked the valley. ", "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. ", "Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. ", "The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. ", "Then again the kindly influence ceased to act-I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection. ", "Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself-or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. ", "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. ", "Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. ", "For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. ", "The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; ", "when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; ", "I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion. ", "Chapter 10   ", "I spent the following day roaming through the valley. ", "I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley. ", "The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; ", "the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; ", "a few shattered pines were scattered around; ", "and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. ", "These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. ", "They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. ", "In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. ", "I retired to rest at night; ", "my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. ", "They congregated round me; ", "the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds-they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace. ", "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? ", "All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. ", "The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. ", "Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. ", "What were rain and storm to me? ", "My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert. ", "I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. ", "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. ", "The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. ", "I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene. ", "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. ", "It is a scene terrifically desolate. ", "In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. ", "The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; ", "one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. ", "The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. ", "I looked on the valley beneath; ", "vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. ", "Alas! ", "Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; ", "it only renders them more necessary beings. ", "If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; ", "but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us. ", "We rest; ", "a dream has power to poison sleep. ", "We rise; ", "one wand'ring thought pollutes the day. ", "We feel, conceive, or reason; ", "laugh or weep,        Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; ", "   ", "It is the same: ", " for, be it joy or sorrow,        The path of its departure still is free. ", "Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; ", "       Nought may endure but mutability! ", "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. ", "For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. ", "A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. ", "Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. ", "The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. ", "The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. ", "The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. ", "From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; ", "and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. ", "I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. ", "The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. ", "Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. ", "My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; ", "I exclaimed, \"Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life. ", "\" As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.

", "I was troubled; ", "a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.

", "Chapter 11   ", "\"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; ", "all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. ", "A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; ", "and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. ", "By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. ", "Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. ", "I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. ", "Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; ", "but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. ", "The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. ", "This was the forest near Ingolstadt; ", "and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. ", "This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. ", "I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep. ", "\"It was dark when I awoke; ", "I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. ", "Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. ", "I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; ", "I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; ", "but ", "feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept. ", "\"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. ", "I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. ", "[The moon]   ", "I gazed with a kind of wonder. ", "It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. ", "I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. ", "No distinct ideas occupied my mind; ", "all was confused. ", "I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; ", "innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; ", "the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. ", "\"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. ", "I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. ", "I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. ", "I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. ", "Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. ", "Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again. ", "\"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. ", "My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. ", "My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; ", "I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. ", "I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing. ", "\"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. ", "In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. ", "How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! ", "I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. ", "I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. ", "I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. ", "The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. ", "I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. ", "When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. ", "I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; ", "and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep. ", "\"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. ", "I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. ", "I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. ", "When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. ", "I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. ", "I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved. ", "\"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. ", "When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. ", "In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. ", "I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. ", "I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. ", "A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; ", "the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground. ", "\"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; ", "at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. ", "This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. ", "Finding the door open, I entered. ", "An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. ", "He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. ", "His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. ", "But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; ", "here the snow and rain could not penetrate; ", "the ground was dry; ", "and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pand\u00e6monium appeared to the d\u00e6mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. ", "I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; ", "the latter, however, I did not like. ", "Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep. ", "\"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; ", "and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. ", "How miraculous did this appear! ", "The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. ", "The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. ", "One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. ", "The whole village was roused; ", "some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. ", "This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. ", "My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. ", "No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; ", "and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain. \" ", "Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. ", "As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. ", "It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. ", "One part was open, and by that I had crept in; ", "but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; ", "all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me. \" ", "Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. ", "I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. ", "The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm. ", "\"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. ", "It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. ", "I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. ", "The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. ", "Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; ", "her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: ", "she looked patient yet sad. ", "I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. ", "As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. ", "Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. ", "She followed, and they disappeared. ", "Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; ", "and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard. \" ", "On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. ", "In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. ", "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. ", "In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. ", "The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; ", "but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. ", "It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. ", "The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. ", "He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; ", "he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. ", "He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; ", "they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; ", "and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions. ", "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. ", "The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; ", "then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. ", "She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. ", "She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. ", "After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together. ", "\"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. ", "The meal was quickly dispatched. ", "The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. ", "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. ", "One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; ", "the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. ", "The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields. ", "Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. ", "In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; ", "and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. ", "So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds; ", "I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters. ", "\"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest. ", "Chapter 12   ", "\"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. ", "I thought of the occurrences of the day. ", "What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. ", "I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions. ", "\"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. ", "The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal. \" ", "This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. ", "The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. ", "The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. ", "Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. ", "They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles. ", "\"They were not entirely happy. ", "The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. ", "I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. ", "If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. ", "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? ", "They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; ", "they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; ", "they were dressed in excellent clothes; ", "and, still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. ", "What did their tears imply? ", "Did they really express pain? ", "I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic. ", "A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: ", "it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. ", "Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. ", "They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves. ", "This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. ", "I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood. ", "\"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. ", "I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days. ", "\"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. ", "She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. ", "I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden. \" ", "By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. ", "I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. ", "I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. ", "This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. ", "But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. ", "Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. ", "By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; ", "I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ ", "I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. ", "The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._ ", "The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. ", "I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. ", "I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._ ", "\"I spent the winter in this manner. ", "The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; ", "when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; ", "when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. ", "I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. ", "The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. ", "He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. ", "Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; ", "but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. ", "It was not thus with Felix. ", "He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. ", "But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man. ", "\"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. ", "In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. ", "Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. ", "In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. ", "At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha. ", "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. ", "I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; ", "but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? ", "I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. ", "\"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers-their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; ", "but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! ", "At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; ", "and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. ", "Alas! ", "I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. \" ", "As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. ", "From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. ", "Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; ", "and they procured a sufficiency of it. ", "Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; ", "and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced. ", "\"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. ", "This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. ", "\"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. ", "During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; ", "the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. ", "When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. ", "When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. ", "I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; ", "and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; ", "but I did not then understand the signification of these terms. ", "\"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; ", "I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. ", "I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. ", "When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. ", "I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. ", "I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. ", "I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love. \" ", "These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. ", "My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; ", "and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. ", "It was as the ass and the lap-dog; ", "yet ", "surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration. ", "\"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. ", "Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. ", "The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. ", "Happy, happy earth! ", "Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. ", "My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; ", "the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy. ", "Chapter 13   ", "\"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. ", "I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am. ", "Spring advanced rapidly; ", "the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. ", "It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. ", "My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. ", "\"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour-the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him-that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; ", "he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow. ", "Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. ", "\"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. ", "The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. ", "Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. ", "Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. ", "On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. ", "Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; ", "her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; ", "her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. \" ", "Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; ", "his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; ", "and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. ", "She appeared affected by different feelings; ", "wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. ", "She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. ", "He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. ", "Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately. ", "\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. ", "They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. ", "Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. ", "Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. ", "Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. ", "Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; ", "and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. ", "The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; ", "most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others. ", "\"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. ", "When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.' ", "He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. ", "I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible. \" ", "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.

", "She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. ", "The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. ", "\"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. ", "Safie was always gay and happy; ", "she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. ", "\"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; ", "the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; ", "and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered. ", "\"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; ", "and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken. ", "\"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight. \" ", "The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's _Ruins of Empires_. ", "I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. ", "He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. ", "Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; ", "it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. ", "I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans-of their subsequent degenerating-of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. ", "I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. ", "\"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. ", "Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? ", "He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. ", "To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; ", "to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. ", "For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; ", "but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing. ", "\"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. ", "While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. ", "I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood. ", "\"The words induced me to turn towards myself. ", "I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. ", "A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! ", "And what was I? ", "Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. ", "I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; ", "I was not even of the same nature as man. ", "I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; ", "I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; ", "my stature far exceeded theirs. ", "When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. ", "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned? ", "\"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; ", "I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. ", "Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat! \" ", "Of what a strange nature is knowledge! ", "It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. ", "I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death-a state which I feared yet did not understand. ", "I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. ", "The gentle words of Agatha and  the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. ", "The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. ", "Miserable, unhappy wretch! ", "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. ", "I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. ", "But where were my friends and relations? ", "No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; ", "or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. ", "From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. ", "I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. ", "What was I? ", "The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans. ", "\"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them). ", "\" Chapter 14   ", "\"Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. ", "It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was. ", "\"The name of the old man was De Lacey. ", "He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. ", "His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. ", "A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford. ", "\"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. ", "He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. ", "He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. ", "He was tried and condemned to death. ", "The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; ", "all Paris was indignant; ", "and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation. \" ", "Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; ", "his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. ", "He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. ", "After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. ", "Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. ", "The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. ", "Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. \" ", "The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. ", "Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness. \" ", "During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French. ", "She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate. ", "\"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; ", "and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. ", "Before I depart I will give them to you; ", "they will prove the truth of my tale; ", "but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you. \" ", "Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; ", "recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. ", "The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. ", "She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. ", "This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. ", "The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her. ", "\"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. ", "Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. ", "He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris. \" ", "Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions. \" ", "Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; ", "and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; ", "and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. ", "They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; ", "and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. ", "\"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. ", "He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. ", "He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. ", "His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. ", "\"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. ", "The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. ", "The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. ", "His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. ", "This idea was torture to him. ", "He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; ", "and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding. ", "\"He did not succeed. ", "They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country. ", "\"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. ", "Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance. \" ", "Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. ", "He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; ", "but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. ", "The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. ", "\"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. ", "The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; ", "she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate. \" ", "A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; ", "he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. ", "He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn. ", "\"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. ", "A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; ", "her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. ", "By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. ", "She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. ", "Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany. ", "She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. ", "Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. ", "She fell, however, into good hands. ", "The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover. ", "\" Chapter 15  \"Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. ", "It impressed me deeply. ", "I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind. \" ", "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. ", "But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year. ", "\"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books. ", "I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. ", "Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; ", "they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarch's Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. ", "The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; ", "I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations. ", "\"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. ", "They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. ", "In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. ", "The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. ", "But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; ", "his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. ", "The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder. ", "I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it. ", "\"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. ", "I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. ", "I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; ", "I was dependent on none and related to none. ", "' The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my annihilation. ", "My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. ", "What did this mean? ", "Who was I? ", "What was I? ", "Whence did I come? ", "What was my destination? ", "These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them. ", "The volume of _Plutarch's Lives_ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. ", "This book had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. ", "I learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; ", "he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. ", "Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. ", "I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. ", "But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. ", "The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. ", "I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. ", "I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. ", "Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. ", "The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; ", "perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations. ", "\"But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. ", "I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. ", "It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. ", "I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. ", "Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; ", "but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. ", "He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; ", "he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. ", "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me. \" ", "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. ", "Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. ", "At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. ", "It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. ", "You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; ", "this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. ", "You doubtless recollect these papers. ", "Here they are. ", "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; ", "the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; ", "the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. ", "I sickened as I read. ", "'Hateful day when I received life!' ", "I exclaimed in agony. ", "'Accursed creator! ", "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust? ", "God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; ", "but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. ", "Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.' ", "\"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; ", "but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. ", "Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? ", "I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. ", "I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. ", "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. ", "\"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. ", "The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. ", "Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. ", "They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; ", "their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. ", "Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. ", "I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. ", "\"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; ", "and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; ", "their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. ", "But it was all a dream; ", "no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; ", "I was alone. ", "I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. ", "But where was mine? ", "He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him. \" ", "Autumn passed thus. ", "I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. ", "Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; ", "I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. ", "But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; ", "when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. ", "Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. ", "They loved and sympathised with one another; ", "and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. ", "The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; ", "my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; ", "to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. ", "I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. ", "The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. ", "I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: ", "I required kindness and sympathy; ", "but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it. \" ", "The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. ", "My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. ", "I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. ", "I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. ", "My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; ", "I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors. ", "\"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. ", "When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. ", "At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; ", "at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. ", "\"My heart beat quick; ", "this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears. ", "The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. ", "All was silent in and around the cottage; ", "it was an excellent opportunity; ", "yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. ", "Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. ", "The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage. ", "\"I knocked. ", "' Who is there?' said the old man. ", "' Come in.' ", "\"I entered. ", "' Pardon this intrusion,' said I; ", "I am a traveller in want of a little rest; ", "you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.' \"'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; ", "but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.' ", "\"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; ", "I have food; ", "it is warmth and rest only that I need.' ", "\"I sat down, and a silence ensued. ", "I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.

", "\"'They are kind-they are the most excellent creatures in the world; ", "but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.

", "Oh, earth! ", "How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! ", "The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. ", "The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. ", "Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. ", "A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; ", "but I often wandered wide from my path. ", "The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; ", "no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; ", "but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings. ", "\"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. ", "One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; ", "the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. ", "I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. ", "Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. ", "Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me. ", "\"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.

", "I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. ", "She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. ", "I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. ", "She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. ", "On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. ", "I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; ", "but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. ", "I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood. ", "\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! ", "I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. ", "The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. ", "Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. ", "But the agony of my wound overcame me; ", "my pulses paused, and I fainted. ", "\"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.

", "My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. ", "My daily vows rose for revenge-a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured. ", "After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. ", "The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; ", "all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. \" ", "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.

", "\"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. ", "Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. ", "If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. \" ", "Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. ", "As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; ", "I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this?

", "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. ", "My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay. ", "For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils-one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; ", "it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her. ", "I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. ", "During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.

", "But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; ", "and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations. ", "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.

", "Alas, how great was the contrast between us!

", "And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. ", "I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment. ", "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. ", "During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. ", "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. ", "The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. ", "The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. ", "We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. ", "This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. ", "In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; ", "and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene. ", "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. ", "Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. ", "I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. ", "And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? ", "He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. ", "\" I have seen,\" he said, \"the most beautiful scenes of my own country; ", "I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; ", "I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; ", "and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; ", "I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; ", "but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. ", "The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. ", "Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; ", "and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; ", "and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; ", "and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. ", "Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.\" ", "Clerval! ", "Beloved friend! ", "Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. ", "He was a being formed in the \"very poetry of nature. ", "\" His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. ", "His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. ", "But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. ", "The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: ", "-       --The sounding cataract      Haunted him like a passion: ", "the tall rock,      The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,      Their colours and their forms, were then to him      An appetite; ", "a feeling, and a love,      That had no need of a remoter charm,      By thought supplied, or any interest      Unborrow'd from the eye. ", "[Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\".] ", "And where does he now exist? ", "Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? ", "Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;-has this mind perished? ", "Does it now only exist in my memory? ", "No, it is not thus; ", "your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend. ", "Pardon this gush of sorrow; ", "these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. ", "I will proceed with my tale. ", "Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; ", "and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. ", "Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. ", "It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. ", "The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; ", "they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. ", "We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich-places which I had heard of even in my country. ", "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history. ", "Chapter 19  London was our present point of rest; ", "we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. ", "Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; ", "I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. ", "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. ", "But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. ", "Company was irksome to me; ", "when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; ", "the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. ", "But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. ", "I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; ", "this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish. ", "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; ", "he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. ", "The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. ", "He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. ", "His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. ", "In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. ", "He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. ", "I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. ", "I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. ", "I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. ", "Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate. ", "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. ", "He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. ", "Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. ", "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. ", "We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. ", "In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. ", "I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland. ", "We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. ", "This was a new scene to us mountaineers; ", "the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us. ", "From thence we proceeded to Oxford. ", "As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. ", "It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. ", "This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. ", "The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. ", "The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. ", "If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. ", "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; ", "the streets are almost magnificent; ", "and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees. ", "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. ", "I was formed for peaceful happiness. ", "During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. ", "But I am a blasted tree; ", "the bolt has entered my soul; ", "and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be-a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself. ", "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. ", "Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. ", "We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. ", "For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. ", "For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self. ", "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. ", "The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; ", "but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. ", "We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. ", "The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated. ", "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. ", "I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. ", "The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. ", "Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. ", "The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; ", "his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. ", "\"I could pass my life here,\" said he to me; ", "\"and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine. ", "But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. ", "His feelings are for ever on the stretch; ", "and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties. ", "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. ", "For my own part I was not sorry. ", "I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d\u00e6mon's disappointment. ", "He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. ", "This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. ", "I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; ", "if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; ", "and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. ", "Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. ", "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. ", "I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. ", "I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime. ", "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; ", "and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. ", "Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. ", "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. ", "But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. ", "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. ", "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; ", "and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. \" ", "Do you,\" said I, \"enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. ", "I may be absent a month or two; ", "but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; ", "leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; ", "and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.\" ", "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. ", "He entreated me to write often. ", "\"I had rather be with you,\" he said, \"in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; ", "hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence. ", "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. ", "I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion. ", "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. ", "It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. ", "The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. ", "Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant. ", "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. ", "This I hired. ", "It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. ", "The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. ", "I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. ", "As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. ", "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; ", "but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. ", "It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. ", "I thought of Switzerland; ", "it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. ", "Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. ", "Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. ", "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. ", "Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. ", "It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. ", "During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; ", "my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. ", "But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. ", "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; ", "I grew restless and nervous. ", "Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. ", "Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. ", "I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion. ", "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. ", "I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom. ", "Chapter 20   ", "I sat one evening in my laboratory; ", "the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; ", "I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. ", "As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. ", "Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. ", "I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; ", "she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. ", "He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; ", "and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. ", "They might even hate each other; ", "the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? ", "She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; ", "she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. ", "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d\u00e6mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. ", "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? ", "I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; ", "I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; ", "but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; ", "I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race. ", "I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the d\u00e6mon at the casement. ", "A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. ", "Yes, he had followed me in my travels; ", "he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; ", "and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise. ", "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. ", "I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. ", "The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew. ", "I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; ", "and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. ", "I was alone; ", "none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries. ", "Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; ", "it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. ", "A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. ", "I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house. ", "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. ", "I trembled from head to foot; ", "I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; ", "but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot. ", "Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; ", "the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. ", "Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,   ", "\"You have destroyed the work which you began; ", "what is it that you intend? ", "Do you dare to break your promise? ", "I have endured toil and misery; ", "I left Switzerland with you; ", "I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. ", "I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. ", "I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; ", "do you dare destroy my hopes?\" ", "\"Begone! ", "I do break my promise; ", "never ", "will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.\" ", "\"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. ", "Remember that I have power; ", "you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. ", "You are my creator, but I am your master; ", "obey!\" ", "\"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. ", "Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; ", "but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.

", "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; ", "my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. ", "I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; ", "nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. ", "I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. ", "If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a d\u00e6mon whom I had myself created. ", "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. ", "When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. ", "I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. ", "The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; ", "and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; ", "yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; ", "they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. ", "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; ", "it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. ", "He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. ", "He could not any longer delay his departure; ", "but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. ", "He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together. ", "This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. ", "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; ", "I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. ", "The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. ", "The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. ", "I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. ", "With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; ", "and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; ", "and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus. ", "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d\u00e6mon. ", "I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; ", "but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. ", "The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; ", "the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. ", "I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. ", "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; ", "and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. ", "The scene was perfectly solitary; ", "a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. ", "I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. ", "At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea ", "I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. ", "The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. ", "But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. ", "Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; ", "the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. ", "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. ", "The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. ", "I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. ", "I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. ", "Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. ", "I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. ", "I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. ", "I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. ", "I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. ", "I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; ", "I looked upon the sea; ", "it was to be my grave. \" ", "Fiend,\" I exclaimed, \"your task is already fulfilled!\" ", "I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval-all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. ", "This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it. ", "Some hours passed thus; ", "but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. ", "But these gave place to a heavy swell; ", "I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south. ", "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes. ", "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! ", "I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. ", "It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. ", "I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. ", "I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. ", "As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. ", "Fortunately I had money with me. ", "As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. ", "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. ", "They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. ", "As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. ", "\"My good friends,\" said I, \"will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?\" ", "\"You will know that soon enough,\" replied a man with a hoarse voice. ", "\" Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you. ", "\" I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. ", "\"Why do you answer me so roughly?\" ", "I replied. ", "\"Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.\" ", "\"I do not know,\" said the man, \"what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains. ", "\" While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. ", "Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. ", "I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. ", "I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself.\" ", "\"Who is Mr. Kirwin? ", "Why am I to give an account of myself? ", "Is not this a free country?\" ", "\"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. ", "Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night. ", "\" This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. ", "I was innocent; ", "that could easily be proved; ", "accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. ", "I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. ", "Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. ", "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection. ", "Chapter 21   ", "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. ", "He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. ", "About half a dozen men came forward; ", "and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. ", "It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; ", "they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. ", "He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. ", "As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. ", "His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. ", "Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. ", "They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. ", "It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. ", "He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck. ", "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; ", "my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. ", "The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner. ", "The son confirmed his father's account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; ", "and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed. ", "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found. ", "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; ", "it was not cold. ", "They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone. ", "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. ", "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of -- from the place where I had deposited the corpse. ", "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. ", "This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. ", "I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. ", "I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; ", "but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. ", "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. ", "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? ", "I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. ", "The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. ", "I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, \"Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? ", "Two ", "I have already destroyed; ", "other victims await their destiny; ", "but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor-\"   ", "The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. ", "A fever succeeded to this. ", "I lay for two months on the point of death; ", "my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; ", "I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. ", "Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; ", "and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. ", "Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; ", "but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses. ", "Why did I not die? ", "More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? ", "Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; ", "how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! ", "Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? ", "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. ", "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; ", "I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; ", "but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly. ", "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. ", "She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. ", "The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. ", "Her tone expressed her entire indifference; ", "she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings. ", "\"Are you better now, sir?\" said she. ", "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \"I believe I am; ", "but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.\" ", "\"For that matter,\" replied the old woman, \"if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! ", "However, that's none of my business; ", "I am sent to nurse you and get you well; ", "I do my duty with a safe conscience; ", "it were well if everybody did the same. ", "\" I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; ", "but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. ", "The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; ", "I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality. ", "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; ", "a darkness pressed around me; ", "no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; ", "no dear hand supported me. ", "The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; ", "but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. ", "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee? ", "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. ", "He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); ", "and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. ", "It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. ", "He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals. ", "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. ", "I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. ", "At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. ", "Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. ", "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; ", "he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French,  \"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; ", "can I do anything to make you more comfortable?\" ", "\"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; ", "on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.\" ", "\"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. ", "But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.\" ", "\"That is my least concern; ", "I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. ", "Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?\" ", "\"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred. ", "You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. ", "The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path. ", "\" As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. ", "I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,  \"Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. ", "I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. ", "I instantly wrote to Geneva; ", "nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. ", "But you are ill; ", "even now you tremble; ", "you are unfit for agitation of any kind.\" ", "\"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; ", "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?\" ", "\"Your family is perfectly well,\" said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; ", "\"and someone, a friend, is come to visit you. ", "\" I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. ", "I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,  \"Oh! ", "Take him away! ", "I cannot see him; ", "for God's sake, do not let him enter!\" ", "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. ", "He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone,   ", "\"I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.\" ", "\"My father!\" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. ", "\"Is my father indeed come? ", "How kind, how very kind! ", "But where is he, why does he not hasten to me? ", "\" My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; ", "perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. ", "He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it. ", "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. ", "I stretched out my hand to him and cried,  \"Are you then safe-and Elizabeth-and Ernest? ", "\" My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; ", "but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. ", "\" What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!\" said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room. ", "\" You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. ", "And poor Clerval-\"   ", "The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; ", "I shed tears. \" ", "Alas! ", "Yes, my father,\" replied I; ", "some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry. ", "\" We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. ", "Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. ", "But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health. ", "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. ", "The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. ", "More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. ", "Alas! ", "Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? ", "It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. ", "Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; ", "and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. ", "Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; ", "and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins. ", "The season of the assizes approached. ", "I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. ", "Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. ", "I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death. ", "The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; ", "and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison. ", "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. ", "I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. ", "The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. ", "Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; ", "sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt. ", "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. ", "He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; ", "but these words only drew deep groans from me. ", "Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; ", "but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; ", "and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. ", "At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence. ", "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. ", "It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which   ", "I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. ", "My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck-the shadow of a human being. ", "My strength was gone. ", "I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame. ", "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. ", "We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. ", "It was midnight. ", "I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. ", "I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. ", "The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; ", "yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. ", "I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; ", "my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. ", "I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. ", "I was unable to pursue the train of thought; ", "a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.

", "How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me! ", "My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. ", "Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. \" ", "Alas! ", "My father,\" said I, \"how little do you know me. ", "Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.

", "Explanation! ", "You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? ", "If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. ", "But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; ", "and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin. ", "\"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. ", "We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. ", "We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. ", "But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? ", "Tell me, dearest Victor. ", "Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth-Do you not love another? ", "\"You have travelled; ", "you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; ", "and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. ", "But this is false reasoning. ", "I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. ", "But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. ", "Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. ", "I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. ", "Ah! ", "Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.

", "On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. ", "Well, be it so; ", "a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. ", "If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. ", "Alas! ", "What freedom? ", "Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free. ", "Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death. ", "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! ", "I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; ", "but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared to drive me from all hope. ", "Yet I would die to make her happy. ", "If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; ", "yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. ", "My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. ", "He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. ", "I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour. ", "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. ", "My letter was calm and affectionate. ", "\"I fear, my beloved girl,\" I said, \"little happiness remains for us on earth; ", "yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. ", "Chase away your idle fears; ", "to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. ", "I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; ", "when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. ", "I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. ", "But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. ", "This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.\" ", "In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned to Geneva. ", "The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. ", "I saw a change in her also. ", "She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; ", "but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was. ", "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. ", "Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; ", "sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. ", "I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. ", "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; ", "her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. ", "She wept with me and for me. ", "When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. ", "Ah! ", "It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. ", "The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. ", "Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. ", "I remained silent. \" ", "Have you, then, some other attachment?\" ", "\"None on earth. ", "I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. ", "Let the day therefore be fixed; ", "and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.\" ", "\"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. ", "Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. ", "Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. ", "And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived. ", "\" Such were the lessons of my father. ", "But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; ", "nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words \"_I shall be with you on your wedding-night_,\" I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. ", "But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate. ", "Great God! ", "If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. ", "But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; ", "and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim. ", "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. ", "But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. ", "She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret. ", "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. ", "I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. ", "Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government. ", "A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. ", "It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood. ", "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. ", "I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. ", "Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer ", "and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent. ", "Elizabeth seemed happy; ", "my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. ", "But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; ", "and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. ", "My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride. ", "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father's, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. ", "The day was fair, the wind favourable; ", "all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. ", "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. ", "We passed rapidly along; ", "the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Sal\u00eave, the pleasant banks of Montal\u00e8gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; ", "sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. ", "I took the hand of Elizabeth. ", "\"You are sorrowful, my love. ", "Ah! ", "If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.\" ", "\"Be happy, my dear Victor,\" replied Elizabeth; ", "\"there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; ", "and ", "be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. ", "Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. ", "Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. ", "Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. ", "What a divine day! ", "How happy and serene all nature appears!\" ", "Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. ", "But her temper was fluctuating; ", "joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie. ", "The sun sank lower in the heavens; ", "we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. ", "The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. ", "The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. ", "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; ", "the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. ", "The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever. ", "Chapter 23   ", "It was eight o'clock when we landed; ", "we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. ", "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. ", "The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; ", "the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. ", "Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. ", "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. ", "I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; ", "every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished. ", "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, \"What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? ", "What is it you fear?\" ", "\"Oh! ", "Peace, peace, my love,\" replied I; ", "\"this night, and all will be safe; ", "but this night is dreadful, very dreadful. ", "\" I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. ", "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. ", "But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. ", "It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. ", "As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; ", "I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. ", "This state lasted but for an instant; ", "the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room. ", "Great God! ", "Why did I not then expire! ", "Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? ", "She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. ", "Everywhere I turn I see the same figure-her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. ", "Could I behold this and live? ", "Alas! ", "Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. ", "For a moment only did I lose recollection; ", "I fell senseless on the ground. ", "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; ", "their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. ", "I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. ", "She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. ", "I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. ", "The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. ", "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. ", "The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. ", "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. ", "A grin was on the face of the monster; ", "he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. ", "I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; ", "but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake. ", "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. ", "I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; ", "nets were cast, but in vain. ", "After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. ", "After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. ", "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; ", "a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. ", "In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; ", "my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost. ", "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. ", "There were women weeping around; ", "I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; ", "all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. ", "I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. ", "The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; ", "even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; ", "my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. ", "This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. ", "I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed. ", "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; ", "but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. ", "However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. ", "I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. ", "But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. ", "I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. ", "If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. ", "Tears streamed from my eyes. ", "The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; ", "they had then been observed by Elizabeth. ", "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. ", "The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. ", "A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; ", "no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; ", "so frightful an event is single in the history of man. ", "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? ", "Mine has been a tale of horrors; ", "I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. ", "Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; ", "I was left desolate. ", "My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration. ", "I arrived at Geneva. ", "My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. ", "I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! ", "His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight-his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. ", "Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! ", "He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; ", "the springs of existence suddenly gave way; ", "he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms. ", "What then became of me? ", "I know not; ", "I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. ", "Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. ", "Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. ", "For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation. ", "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. ", "As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause-the monster whom I had created, the miserable d\u00e6mon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. ", "I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. ", "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; ", "I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; ", "and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. ", "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. \" ", "Be assured, sir,\" said he, \"no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.\" ", "\"I thank you,\" replied I; ", "listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. ", "It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. ", "The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood. ", "\" My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; ", "I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. ", "I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. ", "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; ", "I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; ", "at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. ", "When I had concluded my narration, I said, \"This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. ", "It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion. ", "\" This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. ", "He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; ", "but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. ", "He, however, answered mildly, \"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. ", "Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? ", "Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.\" ", "\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. ", "But I perceive your thoughts; ", "you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert. ", "\" As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; ", "the magistrate was intimidated. ", "\" You are mistaken,\" said he. ", "\" I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. ", "But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; ", "and ", "thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.\" ", "\"That cannot be; ", "but all that I can say will be of little avail. ", "My revenge is of no moment to you; ", "yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. ", "My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.

", "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. ", "The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. ", "The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; ", "and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. ", "The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. ", "One inscription that he left was in these words: ", "Prepare! ", "Your toils only begin; ", "wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred. ", "\" My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; ", "I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. ", "Oh! ", "How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! ", "Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. ", "The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. ", "I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and grapple with him. ", "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. ", "I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. ", "With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. ", "I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. ", "A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. ", "He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; ", "and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts. ", "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. ", "He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. ", "Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. ", "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. ", "I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land. ", "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. ", "Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. ", "But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. ", "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; ", "and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. ", "Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. ", "Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. ", "I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. ", "Oh! ", "With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! ", "Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the d\u00e6mon; ", "but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud. ", "But this was not the time for delay; ", "I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. ", "The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. ", "I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me. ", "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. ", "A ground sea was heard; ", "the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. ", "I pressed on, but in vain. ", "The wind arose; ", "the sea roared; ", "and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. ", "The work was soon finished; ", "in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death. ", "In this manner many appalling hours passed; ", "several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. ", "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. ", "I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship. ", "I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. ", "I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. ", "But your direction was northwards. ", "You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled. ", "Oh! ", "When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d\u00e6mon, allow me the rest I so much desire; ", "or must I die, and he yet live?

", "Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live-swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.

' ", "That's the spirit I like,' said the Director once more. ' ", "Let's walk round. ", "You tell them everything, Mr. Foster.' ", "Mr. Foster duly told them. ", "Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. ", "Made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. ", "Explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. ", "Told them of the corpus luteum extract. ", "Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. ", "Spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course. ", "Described the artificial maternal circulation installed on every bottle at metres 112; ", "showed them the reservoir of blood-surrogate, the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste-product filter. ", "Referred to the embryo's troublesome tendency to an\u00e6mia, to the massive doses of hog's stomach extract and foetal foal's liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied. ", "Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two metres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into familiarity with movement. ", "Hinted at the gravity of the so-called 'trauma of decanting,' and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. ", "Told them of the tests for sex carried out in the neighbourhood of metre 200. ", "Explained the system of labelling-a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground. ' ", "For of course,' said Mr. Foster, 'in the vast majority of cases, fertility is merely a nuisance. ", "One fertile ovary in twelve hundred-that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes. ", "But we want to have a good choice. ", "And of course one must always leave an enormous margin of safety. ", "So we allow as many as thirty per cent. of the female embryos to develop normally. ", "The others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course. ", "Result: ", "they're decanted as freemartins-structurally quite normal (except,' he had to admit, 'that they do have just the slightest tendency to grow beards), but sterile. ", "Guaranteed sterile. ", "Which brings us at last,' continued Mr. Foster, 'out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.' ", "He rubbed his hands. ", "For, of course, they didn't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos: ", "any cow could do that. ' ", "We also predestine and condition. ", "We decant our babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future... ", "He was going to say 'future World Controllers,' but correcting himself, said 'future Directors of Hatcheries' instead. ", "The D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile. ", "They were passing metre 320 on rack eleven. ", "A young Beta-Minus mechanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle.

", "He moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump. ' ", "Reducing the number of revolutions per minute,' Mr. Foster explained. ' ", "The surrogate goes round slower; ", "therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals; ", "therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. ", "Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.' ", "Again he rubbed his hands. ' ", "But why do you want to keep the embryo below par?' asked an ingenuous student. ' ", "Ass!' said the Director, breaking a long silence. ' ", "Hasn't it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity?' ", "It evidently hadn't occurred to him. ", "He was covered with confusion. ' ", "The lower the caste,' said Mr. Foster, 'the shorter the oxygen.' ", "The first organ affected was the brain. ", "After that the skeleton. ", "At seventy per cent. of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. ", "At less than seventy, eyeless monsters. ' ", "Who are no use at all,' concluded Mr. Foster. ", "Whereas (his voice became confidential and eager), if they could discover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a triumph, what a benefaction to Society! ' ", "Consider the horse.' ", "They considered it. ", "Mature at six; ", "the elephant at ten. ", "While at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature; ", "and is only full grown at twenty. ", "Hence, of course, that fruit of delayed development, the human intelligence. ' ", "But in Epsilons,' said Mr. Foster very justly, 'we don't need human intelligence.' ", "Didn't need and didn't get it. ", "But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten, the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. ", "Long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity. ", "If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow's, what an enormous saving to the Community! ' ", "Enormous!' murmured the students. ", "Mr. Foster's enthusiasm was infectious. ", "He became rather technical; ", "spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination which made men grow so slowly; ", "postulated a germinal mutation to account for it. ", "Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? ", "Could the individual Epsilon embryo be made to revert, by a suitable technique, to the normality of dogs and cows? ", "That was the problem. ", "And it was all but solved. ", "Pilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full grown at six and a half. ", "A scientific triumph. ", "But socially useless. ", "Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work. ", "And the process was an all-or-nothing one; ", "either you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. ", "They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. ", "So far without success. ", "Mr. Foster sighed and shook his head. ", "Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighbourhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9. ", "From this point onwards Rack 9 was enclosed and the bottles performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide. ' ", "Heat conditioning,' said Mr. Foster. ", "Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. ", "Coolness was wedded to discomfort in the form of hard X-rays. ", "By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. ", "They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics, to be miners and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. ", "Later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. ' ", "We condition them to thrive on heat,' concluded Mr. Foster. ", "Our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it.' ' ", "And that,' put in the Director sententiously, 'that is the secret of happiness and virtue-liking what you've got to do. ", "All conditioning aims at that: ", "making people like their unescapable social destiny.' ", "In a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. ", "The students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence. ' ", "Well, Lenina,' said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up. ", "The girl turned with a start. ", "One could see that, for all the lupus and the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty. ' ", "Henry!' ", "Her smile flashed redly at him-a row of coral teeth. ' ", "Charming, charming,' murmured the Director and, giving her two or three little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself. ' ", "What are you giving them?' asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very professional. ' ", "Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.' ' ", "Tropical workers start being inoculated at metre 150,' Mr. Foster explained to the students. ' ", "The embryos still have gills. ", "We immunize the fish against the future man's diseases.' ", "Then, turning back to Lenina, 'Ten to five on the roof this afternoon,' he said, 'as usual.' ' ", "Charming,' said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away after the others. ", "On Rack 10 rows of next generation's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead, caustic soda, tar, chlorine. ", "The first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundredth metre mark on Rack 3. ", "A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. ' ", "To improve their sense of balance,' Mr. Foster explained. ' ", "Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid air is a ticklish job. ", "We slacken off the circulation when they're right way up, so that they're half starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they're upside down. ", "They learn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being; ", "in fact, they're only truly happy when they're standing on their heads.' ' ", "And now,' Mr. Foster went on, 'I'd like to show you some very interesting conditioning for Alpha-Plus Intellectuals. ", "We have a big batch of them on Rack 5.

' ", "No time for the intellectual embryos, I'm afraid. ", "We must go up to the Nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep.' ", "Mr. Foster was disappointed. ' ", "At least one glance at the Decanting Room,' he pleaded. ' ", "Very well, then.' ", "The Director smiled indulgently. ' ", "Just one glance.'

", "NEO-PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING ROOMS, announced the notice board. ", "The Director opened a door. ", "They were in a large bare room, very bright and sunny; ", "for the whole of the southern wall was a single window. ", "Half a dozen nurses, trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen uniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white caps, were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. ", "Big bowls, packed tight with blossom. ", "Thousands of petals, ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like the cheeks of innumerable little cherubs, but of cherubs, in that bright light, not exclusively pink and Aryan, but also luminously Chinese, also Mexican, also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also pale as death, pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble. ", "The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in. 'Set out the books,' he said curtly. ", "In silence the nurses obeyed his command. ", "Between the rose bowls the books were duly set out-a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird. ' ", "Now bring in the children.' ", "They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki. ' ", "Put them down on the floor.' ", "The infants were unloaded. ' ", "Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.' ", "Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. ", "As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. ", "The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; ", "a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. ", "From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure. ", "The Director rubbed his hands. ' ", "Excellent!' ", "he said. ' ", "It might almost have been done on purpose.' ", "The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. ", "Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. ", "The Director waited until all were happily busy. ", "Then, 'Watch carefully,' he said. ", "And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal. ", "The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever. ", "There was a violent explosion. ", "Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. ", "Alarm bells maddeningly sounded. ", "The children started, screamed; ", "their faces were distorted with terror. ' ", "And now,' the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), 'now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.' ", "He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. ", "The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. ", "There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. ", "Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; ", "their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires. ' ", "We can electrify that whole strip of floor,' bawled the Director in explanation. ' ", "But that's enough,' he signalled to the nurse. ", "The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. ", "The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror. ' ", "Offer them the flowers and the books again.' ", "The nurses obeyed; ", "but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror; ", "the volume of their howling suddenly increased. ' ", "Observe,' said the Director triumphantly, 'observe.' ", "Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks-already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; ", "and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. ", "What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder. ' ", "They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an \"instinctive\" hatred of books and flowers. ", "Reflexes unalterably conditioned. ", "They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives.' ", "The Director turned to his nurses. ' ", "Take them away again.' ", "Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence. ", "One of the students held up his hand; ", "and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-caste people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably de-condition one of their reflexes, yet... ", "well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. ", "Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers? ", "Patiently the D.H.C. explained. ", "If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. ", "Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers-flowers in particular and wild nature in general. ", "The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport. ' ", "And didn't they consume transport?' asked the student. ' ", "Quite a lot,' the D.H.C. replied. ' ", "But nothing else.' ", "Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: ", "they are gratuitous. ", "A love of nature keeps no factories busy. ", "It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; ", "to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. ", "For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. ", "The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. ", "It was duly found. ' ", "We condition the masses to hate the country,' concluded the Director. ' ", "But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. ", "At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. ", "So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. ", "Hence those electric shocks.' ", "'I see,' said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration. ", "There was a silence; ", "then, clearing his throat, 'Once upon a time,' the Director began, 'while Our Ford was still on earth, there was a little boy called Reuben Rabinovitch. ", "Reuben was the child of Polish-speaking parents.' ", "The Director interrupted himself. ' ", "You know what Polish is, I suppose?' ' ", "A dead language.' ' ", "Like French and German,' added another student, officiously showing off his learning. ' ", "And \"parent?\"?' questioned the D.H.C.   ", "There was an uneasy silence.

' ", "And when the babies were decanted... ", "'  '\"Born\",' came the correction. ' ", "Well, then they were the parents", "I mean, not the babies, of course; ", "the other ones.' ", "The poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion. ' ", "In brief,' the Director summed up, 'the parents were the father and the mother.' ", "The smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys' eye-avoiding silence.

", "To Little Reuben's wink and snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and, imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor. ", "He, fortunately, understood English, recognized the discourse as that which Shaw had broadcasted the previous evening, realized the significance of what had happened, and sent a letter to the medical press about it.

", "Indeed, a faint hypnop\u00e6dic prejudice in favour of size was universal. ", "Hence the laughter of the women to whom he made proposals, the practical joking of his equals among the men. ", "The mockery made him feel an outsider; ", "and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. ", "Which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. ", "A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dignity.

", "Then, turning to his secretary, 'I'll leave you to put my things away,' he went on in the same official and impersonal tone; ", "and, ignoring her lustrous smile, got up and walked briskly to the door. ", "He was a powerfully built man, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, massive, and yet quick in his movements, springy and agile. ", "The round strong pillar of his neck supported a beautifully shaped head. ", "His hair was dark and curly, his features strongly marked. ", "In a forcible emphatic way, he was handsome and looked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an Alpha-Plus. ", "By profession he was a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering (Department of Writing) and in the intervals of his educational activities, a working Emotional Engineer. ", "He wrote regularly for The Hourly Radio, composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hypnop\u00e6dic rhymes. ' ", "Able,' was the verdict of his superiors. ' ", "Perhaps' (and they would shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) 'a little too able.' ", "Yes, a little too able; ", "they were right. ", "A mental excess had produced in Helmholtz Watson effects very similar to those which, in Bernard Marx, were the result of a physical defect. ", "Too little bone and brawn had isolated Bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its turn a cause of wider separation. ", "That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much ability. ", "What the two men shared was the knowledge that they were individuals. ", "But whereas the physically defective Bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite recently that, grown aware of his mental excess, Helmholtz Watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. ", "This Escalator-Squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests. ", "Really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else. ", "But in what? ", "In what? ", "That was the problem which Bernard had come to discuss with him-or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more. ", "Three charming girls from the Bureau of Propaganda by Synthetic Voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift. ' ", "Oh, Helmholtz darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us on Exmoor.' ", "They clung round him imploringly. ", "He shook his head, he pushed his way through them. ' ", "No, no.' ", "'We're not inviting any other man.' ", "But Helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. ' ", "No,' he repeated, 'I'm busy.' ", "And he held resolutely on his course. ", "The girls trailed after him. ", "It was not till he had actually climbed into Bernard's plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. ", "Not without reproaches. ' ", "These women!' ", "he said, as the machine rose into the air. ' ", "These women!' ", "And he shook his head, he frowned. ' ", "Too awful.' ", "Bernard hypocritically agreed, wishing, as he spoke the words, that he could have as many girls as Helmholtz did, and with as little trouble. ", "He was seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. ' ", "I'm taking Lenina Crowne to New Mexico with me,' he said in a tone as casual as he could make it. ' ", "Are you?' said Helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. ", "Then after a little pause, 'This last week or two,' he went on, 'I've been cutting all my committees and all my girls. ", "You can't imagine what a hullabaloo they've been making about it at the College. ", "Still, it's been worth it, I think. ", "The effects... ", "He hesitated. ' ", "Well, they're odd, they're very odd.' ", "A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. ", "The process, it seemed, was reversible. ", "Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism. ", "The rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. ", "When they had arrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic sofas in Bernard's room, Helmholtz began again. ", "Speaking very slowly, 'Did you ever feel,' he asked, 'as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? ", "Some sort of extra power that you aren't using-you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?' ", "He looked at Bernard questioningly. ' ", "You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?' ", "Helmholtz shook his head. ' ", "Not quite. ", "I'm thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feeling that I've got something important to say and the power to say it-only I don't know what it is, and I can't make any use of the power. ", "If there was some different way of writing... ", "Or else something else to write about... ", "He was silent; ", "then, 'You see,' he went on at last, 'I'm pretty good at inventing phrases-you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you jump, almost as though you'd sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they're about something hypnop\u00e6dically obvious. ", "But that doesn't seem enough. ", "It's not enough for the phrases to be good; ", "what you make with them ought to be good too.' ' ", "But your things are good, Helmholtz.' ", "'Oh, as far as they go.' ", "Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. ' ", "But they go such a little way. ", "They aren't important enough, somehow. ", "I feel I could do something much more important. ", "Yes, and more intense, more violent. ", "But what? ", "What is there more important to say? ", "And how can one be violent about the sort of things one's expected to write about? ", "Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly-they'll go through anything. ", "You read and you're pierced. ", "That's one of the things I try to teach my students-how to write piercingly. ", "But what on earth's the good of being pierced by an article about a Community Sing, or the latest improvement in scent organs? ", "Besides, can you make words really piercing-you know, like the very hardest X-rays-when you're writing about that sort of thing? ", "Can you say something about nothing? ", "That's what it finally boils down to. ", "I try and I try... ", "'  'Hush!' said Bernard suddenly, and lifted a warning finger; ", "they listened. ' ", "I believe there's somebody at the door,' he whispered. ", "Helmholtz got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. ", "There was, of course, nobody there. ' ", "I'm sorry,' said Bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. ' ", "I suppose I've got things on my nerves a bit. ", "When people are suspicious with you, you start being suspicious with them.' ", "He passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plaintive. ", "He was justifying himself. ' ", "If you knew what I'd had to put up with recently,' he said almost tearfully-and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain suddenly released. ' ", "If you only knew!' ", "Helmholtz Watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. ' ", "Poor little Bernard!' ", "he said to himself. ", "But at the same time he felt rather ashamed for his friend. ", "He wished Bernard would show a little more pride. ", "Chapter V  \u00a7 1 By eight o'clock the light was failing. ", "The loud-speakers in the tower of the Stoke Poges Club House began, in a more than human tenor, to announce the closing of the courses. ", "Lenina and Henry abandoned their game and walked back towards the Club. ", "From the grounds of the Internal and External Secretion Trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle which provided, with their hormones and their milk, the raw materials for the great factory at Farnham Royal. ", "An incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. ", "Every two and a half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the departure of one of the light monorail trains which carried the lower-caste golfers back from their separate course to the metropolis. ", "Lenina and Henry climbed into their machine and started off. ", "At eight hundred feet Henry slowed down the helicopter screws, and they hung for a minute or two poised above the fading landscape. ", "The forest of Burnham Beeches stretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the western sky. ", "Crimson at the horizon, the last of the sunset faded, through orange, upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. ", "Northwards, beyond and above the trees, the Internal and External Secretions factory glared with a fierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. ", "Beneath them lay the buildings of the Golf Club-the huge lower-caste barracks and, on the other side of a dividing wall, the smaller houses reserved for Alpha and Beta members. ", "The approaches to the monorail station were black with the ant-like pullulation of lower-caste activity. ", "From under the glass vault a lighted train shot out into the open. ", "Following its south-easterly course across the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the Slough Crematorium. ", "For the safety of night-flying planes, its four tall chimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. ", "It was a landmark. ' ", "Why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies round them?' enquired Lenina. ' ", "Phosphorus recovery,' explained Henry telegraphically. ' ", "On their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. ", "P{2}O{5} used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. ", "Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent. of it. ", "More than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. ", "Which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from England alone.' ", "Henry spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing whole-heartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. ' ", "Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we're dead. ", "Making plants grow.' ", "Lenina, meanwhile, had turned her eyes away and was looking perpendicularly downwards at the monorail station. ' ", "Fine,' she agreed. ' ", "But queer that Alphas and Betas won't make any more plants grow than those nasty little Gammas and Deltas and Epsilons down there.' ' ", "All men are physico-chemically equal,' said Henry sententiously. ' ", "Besides, even Epsilons perform indispensable services.' ' ", "Even an Epsilon... ", "Lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when, as a little girl at school, she had woken up in the middle of the night and become aware, for the first time, of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps. ", "She saw again the beam of moonlight, the row of small white beds; ", "heard once more the soft, soft voice that said (the words were there, unforgotten, unforgettable after so many night-long repetitions): 'Every one works for every one else. ", "We can't do without any one. ", "Even Epsilons are useful. ", "We couldn't do without Epsilons. ", "Every one works for every one else. ", "We can't do without any one... ", "Lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise; ", "her speculations through half a wakeful hour; ", "and then, under the influence of those endless repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the soothing, the smoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep.... ", " 'I suppose Epsilons don't really mind being Epsilons,' she said aloud. ' ", "Of course they don't. ", "How can they? ", "They don't know what it's like being anything else. ", "We'd mind, of course. ", "But then we've been differently conditioned. ", "Besides, we start with a different heredity.' ", "'I'm glad I'm not an Epsilon,' said Lenina, with conviction. ' ", "And if you were an Epsilon,' said Henry, 'your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren't a Beta or an Alpha.' ", "He put his forward propeller into gear and headed the machine towards London. ", "Behind them, in the west, the crimson and orange were almost faded; ", "a dark bank of cloud had crept into the zenith. ", "As they flew over the Crematorium, the plane shot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys, only to fall as suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond. ' ", "What a marvellous switchback!' ", "Lenina laughed delightedly. ", "But Henry's tone was almost, for a moment, melancholy. ' ", "Do you know what that switchback was?' ", "he said. ' ", "It was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. ", "Going up in a squirt of hot gas. ", "It would be curious to know who it was-a man or a woman, an Alpha or an Epsilon....' ", "He sighed. ", "Then, in a resolutely cheerful voice, 'Anyhow,' he concluded, 'there's one thing we can be certain of; ", "whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive. ", "Everybody's happy now.' ", "Yes, everybody's happy now,' echoed Lenina. ", "They had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years. ", "Landing on the roof of Henry's forty-story apartment house in Westminster, they went straight down to the dining-hall. ", "There, in a loud and cheerful company, they ate an excellent meal. ", "Soma was served with the coffee. ", "Lenina took two half-gramme tablets and Henry three. ", "At twenty past nine they walked across the street to the newly opened Westminster Abbey Cabaret.

", "The Sixteen Sexophonists were playing an old favourite: ", "There ain't no Bottle in all the world like that dear little Bottle of mine.' ", "Four hundred couples were five-stepping round the polished floor. ", "Lenina and Henry were soon the four hundred and first. ", "The sexophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon, moaned in the alto and tenor registers as though the little death were upon them. ", "Rich with a wealth of harmonics, their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax, louder and ever louder-until at last, with a wave of his hand, the conductor let loose the final shattering note of ethermusic and blew the sixteen merely human blowers clean out of existence. ", "Thunder in A flat major. ", "And then, in all but silence, in all but darkness, there followed a gradual deturgescence, a diminuendo sliding gradually, through quarter tones, down, down to a faintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on (while the five-four rhythms still pulsed below) charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy. ", "And at last expectancy was fulfilled. ", "There was a sudden explosive sunrise, and simultaneously, the Sixteen burst into song: ", "Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted! ", "Bottle of mine, why was I ever decanted? ", "Skies are blue inside of you,   The weather's always fine; ", "For There ain't no Bottle in all the world Like that dear little Bottle of mine.

", "How kind, how good-looking, how delightfully amusing every one was! ' ", "Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted... ", "But Lenina and Henry had what they wanted... ", "They were inside, here and now-safely inside with the fine weather, the perennially blue sky. ", "And when, exhausted, the Sixteen had laid by their sexophones and the Synthetic Music apparatus was producing the very latest in slow Malthusian Blues, they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves of a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate.

", "Obediently, with all the others, Lenina and Henry left the building. ", "The depressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. ", "But though the separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great extent dissolved, the two young people still retained their happy ignorance of the night. ", "Swallowed half an hour before closing time, that second dose of soma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds. ", "Bottled, they crossed the street; ", "bottled, they took the lift up to Henry's room on the twenty-eighth floor. ", "And yet, bottled as she was, and in spite of that second gramme of soma, Lenina did not forget to take all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regulations. ", "Years of intensive hypnop\u00e6dia and, from twelve to seventeen, Malthusian drill three times a week had made the taking of these precautions almost as automatic and inevitable as blinking.

' ", "Damn, I'm late,' Bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of Big Henry, the Singery clock. ", "And sure enough, as he was paying off his cab, Big Henry sounded the hour. ' ", "Ford,' sang out an immense bass voice from all the golden trumpets. ' ", "Ford, Ford, Ford... ", "Nine times. ", "Bernard ran for the lift. ", "The great auditorium for Ford's Day celebrations and other massed Community Sings was at the bottom of the building. ", "Above it, a hundred to each floor, were the seven thousand rooms used by Solidarity Groups for their fortnightly services.

", "If only he had given himself time to look round instead of scuttling for the nearest chair! ", "He could have sat between Fifi Bradlaugh and Joanna Diesel. ", "Instead of which he had gone and blindly planted himself next to Morgana. ", "Morgana! ", "Ford! ", "Those black eyebrows of hers-that eyebrow, rather-for they met above the nose. ", "Ford! ", "And on his right was Clara Deterding. ", "True, Clara's eyebrows didn't meet. ", "But she was really too pneumatic. ", "Whereas Fifi and Joanna were absolutely right.

", "Lenina was shocked by his blasphemy. ' ", "Bernard!' ", "she protested in a voice of amazed distress. ' ", "How can you?' ", "In a different key, 'How can I?' ", "he repeated meditatively. ' ", "No, the real problem is: ", "How is it that I can't, or rather-because, after all, I know quite well why I can't-what would it be like if I could, if I were free-not enslaved by my conditioning.' ' ", "But, Bernard, you're saying the most awful things.' ' ", "Don't you wish you were free, Lenina?' ", "'I don't know what you mean. ", "I am free. ", "Free to have the most wonderful time.

", "'I don't understand anything,' she said with decision, determined to preserve her incomprehension intact. ' ", "Nothing. ", "Least of all,' she continued in another tone, 'why you don't take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. ", "You'd forget all about them. ", "And instead of feeling miserable, you'd be jolly. ", "So jolly,' she repeated and smiled, for all the puzzled anxiety in her eyes, with what was meant to be an inviting and voluptuous cajolery. ", "He looked at her in silence, his face unresponsive and very grave-looked at her intently. ", "After a few seconds Lenina's eyes flinched away; ", "she uttered a nervous little laugh, tried to think of something to say and couldn't. ", "The silence prolonged itself. ", "When Bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. ' ", "All right then,' he said, 'we'll go back.' ", "And stepping hard on the accelerator, he sent the machine rocketing up into the sky. ", "At four thousand he started his propeller. ", "They flew in silence for a minute or two. ", "Then, suddenly, Bernard began to laugh. ", "Rather oddly, Lenina thought; ", "but still, it was laughter. ' ", "Feeling better?' ", "she ventured to ask. ", "For answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm round her, began to fondle her breasts. ' ", "Thank Ford,' she said to herself, 'he's all right again.' ", "Half an hour later they were back in his rooms. ", "Bernard swallowed four tablets of soma at a gulp, turned on the radio and television and began to undress.

", "A little jolt, and they were off. ' ", "Every one says I'm awfully pneumatic,' said Lenina reflectively, patting her own legs. ' ", "Awfully.' ", "But there was an expression of pain in Bernard's eyes. ' ", "Like meat,' he was thinking. ", "She looked up with a certain anxiety. ' ", "But you don't think I'm too plump, do you?'

' ", "All the same,' he went on, after a little pause, 'I still rather wish it had all ended differently.' ' ", "Differently?' Were there other endings? ' ", "I didn't want it to end with our going to bed,' he specified. ", "Lenina was astonished. ' ", "Not at once, not the first day.' ", "But then what... ", "He began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. ", "Lenina did her best to stop the ears of her mind; ", "but every now and then a phrase would insist on becoming audible. '... ", "to try the effect of arresting my impulses,' she heard him say. ", "The words seemed to touch a spring in her mind. ' ", "Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day,' she said gravely. ' ", "Two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half,' was all his comment. ", "The mad bad talk rambled on. ' ", "I want to know what passion is,' she heard him saying. ' ", "I want to feel something strongly.' ' ", "When the individual feels, the community reels,' Lenina pronounced. ' ", "Well, why shouldn't it reel a bit?' ' ", "Bernard!' ", "But Bernard remained unabashed. ' ", "Adults intellectually and during working hours,' he went on. ' ", "Infants where feeling and desire are concerned.' ' ", "Our Ford loved infants.' ", "Ignoring the interruption, 'It suddenly struck me the other day,' continued Bernard, 'that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.' ", "'I don't understand.' ", "Lenina's tone was firm. ' ", "I know you don't. ", "And that's why we went to bed together yesterday-like infants-instead of being adults and waiting.' ' ", "But it was fun,' Lenina insisted. ' ", "Wasn't it?' ", "Oh, the greatest fun,' he answered, but in a voice so mournful, with an expression so profoundly miserable, that Lenina felt all her triumph suddenly evaporate. ", "Perhaps he had found her too plump, after all. ' ", "I told you so,' was all that Fanny said, when Lenina came and made her confidences. ' ", "It's the alcohol they put in his surrogate.' ' ", "All the same,' Lenina insisted. ' ", "I do like him. ", "He has such awfully nice hands. ", "And the way he moves his shoulders-that's very attractive.' ", "She sighed.

", "He pencilled his initials-two small pale letters abject at the feet of Mustapha Mond--and was about to return the paper without a word of comment or genial Ford-speed, when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the permit. ' ", "For the New Mexican Reservation?' ", "he said, and his tone, the face he lifted to Bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment. ", "Surprised by his surprise, Bernard nodded. ", "There was a silence. ", "The Director leaned back in his chair, frowning. ' ", "How long ago was it?' ", "he said, speaking more to himself than to Bernard. ' ", "Twenty years, I suppose. ", "Nearer twenty-five. ", "I must have been your age... ", "He sighed and shook his head. ", "Bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. ", "A man so conventional, so scrupulously correct as the Director-and to commit so gross a solecism! ", "It made him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. ", "Not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past; ", "that was one of those hypnop\u00e6dic prejudices he had (so he imagined) completely got rid of. ", "What made him feel shy was the knowledge that the Director disapproved-disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. ", "Under what inward compulsion? ", "Through his discomfort Bernard eagerly listened. ' ", "I had the same idea as you,' the Director was saying. ' ", "Wanted to have a look at the savages. ", "Got a permit for New Mexico and went there for my summer holiday. ", "With the girl I was having at the moment. ", "She was a Beta-Minus, and I think' (he shut his eyes). ' ", "I think she had yellow hair. ", "Anyhow, she was pneumatic, particularly pneumatic; ", "I remember that. ", "Well, we went there, and we looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. ", "And then-it was almost the last day of my leave-then... ", "well, she got lost. ", "We'd gone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and oppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. ", "Or at least I did. ", "She must have gone for a walk, alone. ", "At any rate, when I woke up, she wasn't there. ", "And the most frightful thunderstorm I've ever seen was just bursting on us. ", "And it poured and roared and flashed; ", "and the horses broke loose and ran away; ", "and I fell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly walk. ", "Still, I searched and I shouted and I searched. ", "But there was no sign of her. ", "Then I thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. ", "So I crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. ", "My knee was agonizingly painful, and I'd lost my soma. ", "It took me hours. ", "I didn't get back to the rest-house till after midnight. ", "And she wasn't there; ", "she wasn't there,' the Director repeated. ", "There was a silence. ' ", "Well,' he resumed at last, 'the next day there was a search. ", "But we couldn't find her. ", "She must have fallen into a gulley somewhere; ", "or been eaten by a mountain lion. ", "Ford knows. ", "Anyhow it was horrible. ", "It upset me very much at the time. ", "More than it ought to have done, I dare say. ", "Because, after all, it's the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; ", "and, of course, the social body persists although the component cells may change.' ", "But this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. ", "Shaking his head, 'I actually dream about it sometimes,' the Director went on in a low voice. ' ", "Dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; ", "dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.' ", "He lapsed into the silence of reminiscence. ' ", "You must have had a terrible shock,' said Bernard, almost enviously. ", "At the sound of his voice the Director started into a guilty realization of where he was; ", "shot a glance at Bernard, and averting his eyes, blushed darkly; ", "looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily on his dignity, 'Don't imagine,' he said, 'that I'd had any indecorous relation with the girl. ", "Nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. ", "It was all perfectly healthy and normal.' ", "He handed Bernard the permit. ' ", "I really don't know why I bored you with this trivial anecdote.' ", "Furious with himself for having given away a discreditable secret, he vented his rage on Bernard. ", "The look in his eyes was now frankly malignant. ' ", "And I should like to take this opportunity, Mr. Marx,' he went on, 'of saying that I'm not at all pleased with the reports I receive of your behaviour outside working hours. ", "You may say that this is not my business. ", "But it is. ", "I have the good name of the Centre to think of. ", "My workers must be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes. ", "Alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. ", "But that is all the more reason for their making a special effort to conform. ", "It is their duty to be infantile, even against their inclination. ", "And so, Mr. Marx, I give you fair warning.' ", "The Director's voice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and impersonal-was the expression of the disapproval of Society itself. ' ", "If ever I hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum, I shall ask for your transference to a Sub-Centre-preferably to Iceland. ", "Good morning.' ", "And swivelling round in his chair, he picked up his pen and began to write. ' ", "That'll teach him,' he said to himself. ", "But he was mistaken. ", "For Bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; ", "elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance. ", "Even the thought of persecution left him undismayed, was rather tonic than depressing. ", "He felt strong enough to meet and overcome affliction, strong enough to face even Iceland. ", "And this confidence was the greater for his not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face anything at all. ", "People simply weren't transferred for things like that. ", "Iceland was just a threat. ", "A most stimulating and life-giving threat. ", "Walking along the corridor, he actually whistled. ", "Heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the D.H.C. 'Whereupon,' it concluded, 'I simply told him to go to the Bottomless Past and marched out of the room. ", "And that was that.' ", "He looked at Helmholtz Watson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of sympathy, encouragement, admiration. ", "But no word came. ", "Helmholtz sat silent, staring at the floor.

' ", "But it sounds simply too lovely,' cried Lenina. ", "I almost wish we could stay here. ", "Sixty Escalator-Squash Courts... ", "'  'There won't be any in the Reservation,' Bernard warned her. ' ", "And no scent, no television, no hot water, even. ", "If you feel you can't stand it, stay here till I come back.' ", "Lenina was quite offended. ' ", "Of course I can stand it.

' ", "Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,' said Bernard wearily, as though to himself. ' ", "What did you say?' ' ", "I said that progress was lovely. ", "That's why you mustn't come to the Reservation unless you really want to.' ' ", "But I do want to.' 'Very well, then,' said Bernard; ", "and it was almost a threat. ", "Their permit required the signature of the Warden of the Reservation, at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves.

", "supplied with current from the Grand Canyon hydro-electric station.' ' ", "Cost me a fortune by the time I get back.'

", "upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand volts.' ", "'You don't say so,' said Lenina politely, not knowing in the least what the Warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. ", "When the Warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, serenely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue eyes fixed on the Warden's face in an expression of rapt attention. ' ", "To touch the fence is instant death,' pronounced the Warden solemnly. ' ", "There is no escape from a Savage Reservation.' ", "The word 'escape' was suggestive. ' ", "Perhaps,' said Bernard, half rising, 'we ought to think of going.' ", "The little black needle was scurrying, an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money. ' ", "No escape,' repeated the Warden, waving him back into his chair; ", "and as the permit was not yet countersigned, Bernard had no choice but to obey. ' ", "Those who are born in the Reservation-and remember, my dear young lady,' he added, leering obscenely at Lenina, and speaking in an improper whisper, 'remember that, in the Reservation, children still are born, yes, actually born, revolting as that may seem... ", "(He hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make Lenina blush; ", "but she only smiled with simulated intelligence and said, 'You don't say so!' ", "Disappointed, the Warden began again.) ' ", "Those, I repeat, who are born in the Reservation are destined to die there.' ", "Destined to die... ", "A decilitre of eau-de-Cologne every minute. ", "Six litres an hour. ' ", "Perhaps,' Bernard tried again, 'we ought... ", "'   ", "Leaning forward, the Director tapped the table with his forefinger.

", "'My dear young lady, I do say so.' ", "Six times twenty-four-no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. ", "Bernard was pale and trembling with impatience.

", "As recently as a week ago, in the Director's office, he had imagined himself courageously resisting, stoically accepting suffering without a word. ", "The Director's threats had actually elated him, made him feel larger than life. ", "But that, as he now realized, was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously; ", "he had not believed that, when it came to the point, the D.H.C. would ever do anything. ", "Now that it looked as though the threats were really to be fulfilled, Bernard was appalled. ", "Of that imagined stoicism, that theoretical courage, not a trace was left. ", "He raged against himself-what a fool!-against the Director-how unfair not to give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now had no doubt at all, he had always intended to take. ", "And Iceland, Iceland... ", "Lenina shook her head. ' ", "Was and will make me ill,' she quoted, 'I take a gramme and only am.' ", "In the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. ", "Five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; ", "the flower of the present rosily blossomed. ", "A message from the porter announced that, at the Warden's orders, a Reservation Guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. ", "They went up at once. ", "An octoroon in Gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the morning's programme. ", "A bird's-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a landing for lunch in the valley of Malpais. ", "The rest-house was comfortable there, and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be celebrating their summer festival. ", "It would be the best place to spend the night. ", "They took their seats in the plane and set off. ", "Ten minutes later they were crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. ", "Uphill and down, across the deserts of salt or sand, through forests, into the violet depth of canyons, over crag and peak and table-topped mesa, the fence marched on and on, irresistibly the straight line, the geometrical symbol of triumphant human purpose. ", "And at its foot, here and there, a mosaic of white bones, a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place where deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey buzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a poetic justice, had come too close to the destroying wires. ' ", "They never learn,' said the green-uniformed pilot, pointing down at the skeletons on the ground below them. ' ", "And they never will learn,' he added and laughed, as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the electrocuted animals. ", "Bernard also laughed; ", "after two grammes of soma the joke seemed, for some reason, good. ", "Laughed and then, almost immediately, dropped off to sleep and, sleeping, was carried over Taos and Tesuque; ", "over Nambe and Picuris and Pojoaque, over Sia and Cochiti, over Laguna and Acoma and the Enchanted Mesa, over Zu\u00f1i and Cibola and Ojo Caliente, and woke at last to find the machine standing on the ground, Lenina carrying the suit-cases into a small square house, and the Gamma-green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a young Indian. ' ", "Malpais,' explained the pilot, as Bernard stepped out. ' ", "This is the rest-house. ", "And there's a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. ", "He'll take you there.' ", "He pointed to the sullen young savage. ' ", "Funny, I expect.' ", "He grinned. ' ", "Everything they do is funny.' ", "And with that he climbed into the plane and started up the engines. ' ", "Back to-morrow. ", "And remember,' he added reassuringly to Lenina, 'they're perfectly tame; ", "savages won't do you any harm. ", "They've got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn't play any tricks.' ", "Still laughing, he threw the helicopter screws into gear, accelerated, and was gone. ", "Chapter VII   ", "The mesa was like a ship becalmed in a strait of lion-coloured dust. ", "The channel wound between precipitous banks, and slanting from one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green-the river and its fields. ", "On the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait, and seemingly a part of it, a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked rock, stood the pueblo of Malpais. ", "Block above block, each story smaller than the one below, the tall houses rose like stepped and amputated pyramids into the blue sky. ", "At their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of walls; ", "and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. ", "A few columns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were lost. ' ", "Queer,' said Lenina. ' ", "Very queer.' ", "It was her ordinary word of condemnation. ' ", "I don't like it. ", "And I don't like that man.' ", "She pointed to the Indian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. ", "Her feeling was evidently reciprocated; ", "the very back of the man, as he walked along before them, was hostile, sullenly contemptuous. ' ", "Besides,' she lowered her voice, 'he smells.' ", "Bernard did not attempt to deny it. ", "They walked on. ", "Suddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing, pulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. ", "Up there, in Malpais, the drums were being beaten. ", "Their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious heart; ", "they quickened their pace. ", "Their path led them to the foot of the precipice. ", "The sides of the great mesa ship towered over them, three hundred feet to the gunwale. ' ", "I wish we could have brought the plane,' said Lenina, looking up resentfully at the blank impending rock-face. ", "I hate walking. ", "And you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.' ", "They walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa, rounded a projection, and there, in a water-worn ravine, was the way up the companion ladder. ", "They climbed. ", "It was a very steep path that zigzagged from side to side of the gulley. ", "Sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible, at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner. ", "When they were half-way up, an eagle flew past so close to them that the wind of his wings blew chill on their faces. ", "In a crevice of the rock lay a pile of bones. ", "It was all oppressively queer, and the Indian smelt stronger and stronger. ", "They emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. ", "The top of the mesa was a flat deck of stone. ' ", "Like the Charing-T Tower,' was Lenina's comment. ", "But she was not allowed to enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. ", "A padding of soft feet made them turn round. ", "Naked from throat to navel, their dark-brown bodies painted with white lines ('like asphalt tennis courts,' Lenina was later to explain), their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet, black and ochre, two Indians came running along the path. ", "Their black hair was braided with fox fur and red flannel. ", "Cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their shoulders; ", "huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. ", "With every step they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets, their heavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. ", "They came on without a word, running quietly in their deerskin moccasins. ", "One of them was holding a feather brush; ", "the other carried, in either hand, what looked at a distance like three or four pieces of thick rope. ", "One of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly Lenina saw that they were snakes. ", "The men came nearer and nearer; ", "their dark eyes looked at her, but without giving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence. ", "The writhing snake hung limp again with the rest. ", "The men passed. ' ", "I don't like it,' said Lenina. ", "I don't like it.' ", "She liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo, where their guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. ", "The dirt, to start with, the piles of rubbish, the dust, the dogs, the flies. ", "Her face wrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. ", "She held her handkerchief to her nose. ' ", "But how can they live like this?' ", "she broke out in a voice of indignant incredulity. ", "( It wasn't possible.) ", "Bernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. ' ", "Anyhow,' he said, 'they've been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. ", "So I suppose they must be used to it by now.' ' ", "But cleanliness is next to fordliness,' she insisted. ' ", "Yes, and civilization is sterilization,' Bernard went on, concluding on a tone of irony the second hypnop\u00e6dic lesson in elementary hygiene. ' ", "But these people have never heard of Our Ford, and they aren't civilized. ", "So there's no point in... ", " 'Oh!' ", "She gripped his arm. ' ", "Look.' ", "An almost naked Indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the first-floor terrace of a neighbouring house-rung after rung, with the tremulous caution of extreme old age. ", "His face was profoundly wrinkled and black, like a mask of obsidian. ", "The toothless mouth had fallen in. ", "At the corners of the lips, and on each side of the chin a few long bristles gleamed almost white against the dark skin. ", "The long unbraided hair hung down in grey wisps round his face. ", "His body was bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. ", "Very slowly he came down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step. ' ", "What's the matter with him?' whispered Lenina. ", "Her eyes were wide with horror and amazement. ' ", "He's old, that's all,' Bernard answered as carelessly as he could. ", "He too was startled; ", "but he made an effort to seem unmoved. ' ", "Old?' ", "she repeated. ' ", "But the Director's old; ", "lots of people are old; ", "they're not like that.' ", "That's because we don't allow them to be like that. ", "We preserve them from diseases. ", "We keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a youthful equilibrium. ", "We don't permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall below what it was at thirty. ", "We give them transfusions of young blood. ", "We keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. ", "So, of course, they don't look like that. ", "Partly,' he added, 'because most of them die long before they reach this old creature's age. ", "Youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! ", "the end.' ", "But Lenina was not listening. ", "She was watching the old man. ", "Slowly, slowly he came down. ", "His feet touched the ground. ", "He turned. ", "In their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. ", "They looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. ", "Then slowly, with bent back, the old man hobbled past them and was gone. ' ", "But it's terrible,' Lenina whispered. ' ", "It's awful. ", "We ought not to have come here.' ", "She felt in her pocket for her soma-only to discover that, by some unprecedented oversight, she had left the bottle down at the rest-house. ", "Bernard's pockets were also empty. ", "Lenina was left to face the horrors of Malpais unaided. ", "They came crowding in on her thick and fast. ", "The spectacle of two young women giving the breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. ", "She had never seen anything so indecent in her life. ", "And what made it worse was that, instead of tactfully ignoring it, Bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. ", "Ashamed, now that the effects of the soma had worn off, of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel, he went out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox. ' ", "What a wonderfully intimate relationship,' he said, deliberately outrageous. ' ", "And what an intensity of feeling it must generate! ", "I often think one may have missed something in not having had a mother. ", "And perhaps you've missed something in not being a mother, Lenina. ", "Imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own....'  'Bernard! ", "How can you?' ", "The passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation. ' ", "Let's go away,' she begged. ' ", "I don't like it.' ", "But at this moment their guide came back and, beckoning to them to follow, led the way down the narrow street between the houses. ", "They rounded a corner. ", "A dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap; ", "a woman with a goitre was looking for lice in the hair of a small girl. ", "Their guide halted at the foot of a ladder, raised his hand perpendicularly, then darted it horizontally forward. ", "They did what he mutely commanded-climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway, to which it gave access, into a long narrow room, rather dark and smelling of smoke and cooked grease and long-worn, long-unwashed clothes. ", "At the further end of the room was another doorway, through which came a shaft of sunlight and the noise, very loud and close, of the drums. ", "They stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace. ", "Below them, shut in by the tall houses, was the village square, crowded with Indians. ", "Bright blankets, and feathers in black hair, and the glint of turquoise, and dark skins shining with heat. ", "Lenina put her handkerchief to her nose again. ", "In the open space at the centre of the square were two circular platforms of masonry and trampled clay-the roofs, it was evident, of underground chambers; ", "for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway, with a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. ", "A sound of subterranean flute-playing came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of the drums. ", "Lenina liked the drums. ", "Shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. ", "It reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at Solidarity Services and Ford's Day celebrations. ' ", "Orgy-porgy,' she whispered to herself. ", "These drums beat out just the same rhythms. ", "There was a sudden startling burst of singing-hundreds of male voices crying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. ", "A few long notes and silence, the thunderous silence of the drums; ", "then shrill, in a neighing treble, the women's answer. ", "Then again the drums; ", "and once more the men's deep savage affirmation of their manhood. ", "Queer-yes. ", "The place was queer, so was the music, so were the clothes and the goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. ", "But the performance itself-there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that. ' ", "It reminds me of a lower-caste Community Sing,' she told Bernard. ", "But a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous function. ", "For suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers underground a ghastly troop of monsters. ", "Hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; ", "round and again round, singing as they went, round and round-each time a little faster; ", "and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; ", "and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers, louder and louder; ", "and first one woman had shrieked, and then another and another, as though they were being killed; ", "and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. ", "A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with outstretched hands. ", "He tossed the snakes to the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. ", "More and more, black snakes and brown and mottled-he flung them out. ", "And then the dance began again on a different rhythm. ", "Round and round they went with their snakes, snakily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. ", "Round and round. ", "Then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, all the snakes were flung down in the middle of the square; ", "an old man came up from underground and sprinkled them with corn meal, and from the other hatchway came a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. ", "Then the old man lifted his hand and, startlingly, terrifyingly, there was absolute silence. ", "The drums stopped beating, life seemed to have come to an end. ", "The old man pointed towards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. ", "And slowly, raised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross. ", "They hung there, seemingly self-sustained, as though watching. ", "The old man clapped his hands. ", "Naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth, a boy of about eighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him, his hands crossed over his chest, his head bowed. ", "The old man made the sign of the cross over him and turned away. ", "Slowly, the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes. ", "He had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when, from among the dancers, a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in his hand a whip of plaited leather, advanced towards him. ", "The boy moved on as though unaware of the other's existence. ", "The coyote-man raised his whip; ", "there was a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the lash and its loud flat-sounding impact on the flesh. ", "The boy's body quivered; ", "but he made no sound, he walked on at the same slow, steady pace. ", "The coyote struck again, again; ", "and at every blow at first a gasp and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. ", "The boy walked on. ", "Twice, thrice, four times round he went. ", "The blood was streaming. ", "Five times round, six times round. ", "Suddenly Lenina covered her face with her hands and began to sob. ' ", "Oh, stop them, stop them!' ", "she implored. ", "But the whip fell and fell inexorably. ", "Seven times round. ", "Then all at once the boy staggered and, still without a sound, pitched forward on to his face. ", "Bending over him, the old man touched his back with a long white feather, held it up for a moment, crimson, for the people to see, then shook it thrice over the snakes. ", "A few drops fell, and suddenly the drums broke out again into a panic of hurrying notes; ", "there was a great shout. ", "The dancers rushed forward, picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. ", "Men, women, children, all the crowd ran after them. ", "A minute later the square was empty, only the boy remained, prone where he had fallen, quite still. ", "Three old women came out of one of the houses, and with some difficulty lifted him and carried him in. ", "The eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little while over the empty pueblo; ", "then, as though they had seen enough, sank slowly down through their hatchways, out of sight, into the nether world. ", "Lenina was still sobbing. ' ", "Too awful,' she kept repeating, and all Bernard's consolations were in vain. ' ", "Too awful! ", "That blood!' ", "She shuddered. ' ", "Oh, I wish I had my soma.' ", "There was the sound of feet in the inner room. ", "Lenina did not move, but sat with her face in her hands, unseeing, apart. ", "Only Bernard turned round. ", "The dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was Indian; ", "but his plaited hair was straw-coloured, his eyes a pale blue, and his skin a white skin, bronzed. ' ", "Hullo. ", "Good-morrow,' said the stranger, in faultless but peculiar English. ' ", "You're civilized, aren't you? ", "You come from the Other Place, outside the Reservation?' ' ", "Who on earth... ", "Bernard began in astonishment. ", "The young man sighed and shook his head. ' ", "A most unhappy gentleman.' ", "And, pointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square, 'Do you see that damned spot?' ", "he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion. ' ", "A gramme is better than a damn,' said Lenina mechanically from behind her hands. ' ", "I wish I had my soma!' ", "'I ought to have been there.' ", "The young man went on. ' ", "Why wouldn't they let me be the sacrifice? ", "I'd have gone round ten times-twelve, fifteen. ", "Palowhtiwa only got as far as seven. ", "They could have had twice as much blood from me. ", "The multitudinous seas incarnadine.' ", "He flung out his arms in a lavish gesture; ", "then, despairingly, let them fall again. ' ", "But they wouldn't let me. ", "They disliked me for my complexion. ", "It's always been like that. ", "Always.' ", "Tears stood in the young man's eyes; ", "he was ashamed and turned away. ", "Astonishment made Lenina forget the deprivation of soma. ", "She uncovered her face and, for the first time, looked at the stranger. ' ", "Do you mean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip?' ", "Still averted from her, the young man made a sign of affirmation. ' ", "For the sake of the pueblo-to make the rain come and the corn grow. ", "And to please Pookong and Jesus. ", "And then to show that I can bear pain without crying out. ", "Yes,' and his voice suddenly took on a new resonance, he turned with a proud squaring of the shoulders, a proud, defiant lifting of the chin, 'to show that I'm a man... ", "Oh!' ", "He gave a gasp and was silent, gaping. ", "He had seen, for the first time in his life, the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of chocolate or dogskin, whose hair was auburn and permanently waved, and whose expression (amazing novelty!) was one of benevolent interest. ", "Lenina was smiling at him; ", "such a nice-looking boy, she was thinking, and a really beautiful body. ", "The blood rushed up into the young man's face; ", "he dropped his eyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him, and was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other side of the square. ", "Bernard's questions made a diversion. ", "Who? ", "How? ", "When? ", "From where? ", "Keeping his eyes fixed on Bernard's face (for so passionately did he long to see Lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), the young man tried to explain himself. ", "Linda and he-Linda was his mother (the word made Lenina look uncomfortable)-were strangers in the Reservation. ", "Linda had come from the Other Place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father. ", "( Bernard pricked up his ears.) ", "She had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to the North, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. ", "(' Go on, go on,' said Bernard excitedly.) ", "Some hunters from Malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. ", "As for the man who was his father, Linda had never seen him again. ", "His name was Tomakin. ", "( Yes, 'Thomas' was the D.H.C.'s first name.) ", "He must have flown away, back to the Other Place, away without her-a bad, unkind, unnatural man. ' ", "And so I was born in Malpais,' he concluded. ' ", "In Malpais.' ", "And he shook his head. ", "* The squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo! ", "A space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. ", "Two famine-stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. ", "Inside, when they entered, the twilight stank and was loud with flies. ' ", "Linda!' ", "the young man called. ", "From the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, 'Coming.' ", "They waited. ", "In bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, perhaps of several meals. ", "The door opened. ", "A very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold and stood looking at the strangers, staring incredulously, her mouth open. ", "Lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. ", "And the colour of the ones that remained... ", "She shuddered. ", "It was worse than the old man. ", "So fat. ", "And all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. ", "And the sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. ", "And the red veins on her nose, the bloodshot eyes. ", "And that neck-that neck; ", "and the blanket she wore over her head-ragged and filthy. ", "And under the brown sack-shaped tunic those enormous breasts, the bulge of the stomach, the hips. ", "Oh, much worse than the old man, much worse! ", "And suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of speech, rushed at her with outstretched arms and-Ford! ", "Ford! ", "it was too revolting, in another moment she'd be sick-pressed her against the bulge, the bosom, and began to kiss her. ", "Ford! to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn't true about Bernard), positively stank of alcohol. ", "She broke away as quickly as she could. ", "A blubbered and distorted face confronted her; ", "the creature was crying. ' ", "Oh, my dear, my dear.' ", "The torrent of words flowed sobbingly.

", "It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m--'s senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her-an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).'

' ", "But we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.' ", "In the Beta-Minus geography room John learnt that 'a savage reservation is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.' ", "A click; ", "the room was darkened; ", "and suddenly, on the screen above the Master's head, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before Our Lady, and wailing as John had heard them wail, confessing their sins before Jesus on the cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. ", "The young Etonians fairly shouted with laughter. ", "Still wailing, the Penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat themselves, blow after blow. ", "Redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans. ' ", "But why do they laugh?' asked the Savage in a pained bewilderment. ' ", "Why?' ", "The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. ' ", "Why? ", "But because it's so extraordinarily funny.' ", "In the cinematographic twilight, Bernard risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. ", "Strong in his new importance, he put his arm round the Head Mistress's waist. ", "It yielded, willowily. ", "He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again. ' ", "Perhaps we had better go on,' said Miss Keate, and moved towards the door. ' ", "And this,' said the Provost a moment later, 'is the Hypnop\u00e6dic Control Room.' ", "Hundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; ", "pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnop\u00e6dic lessons were printed. ' ", "You slip the roll in here,' explained Bernard, interrupting Dr. Gaffney, 'press down this switch... ", " 'No, that one,' corrected the Provost, annoyed. ' ", "That one, then. ", "The roll unwinds. ", "The selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves, and... ", "'  ' ", "And there you are,' Dr. Gaffney concluded. ' ", "Do they read Shakespeare?' asked the Savage as they walked, on their way to the Bio-chemical Laboratories, past the School Library. ' ", "Certainly not,' said the Head Mistress, blushing. ' ", "Our library,' said Dr. Gaffney, 'contains only books of reference. ", "If our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. ", "We don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.' ", "Five bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement, rolled past them over the vitrified highway.

", "All the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days. ", "They learn to take dying as a matter of course.'

", "** On their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation's factory at Brentford. ' ", "Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?' asked Bernard. ", "The Savage waited and watched. ", "The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty.

", "And it was morning. ", "Bernard was back among the miseries of space and time. ", "It was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the Conditioning Centre. ", "The intoxication of success had evaporated; ", "he was soberly his old self; ", "and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere. ", "To this deflated Bernard the Savage showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic. ' ", "You're more like what you were at Malpais,' he said, when Bernard had told him his plaintive story. ' ", "Do you remember when we first talked together? ", "Outside the little house. ", "You're like what you were then.' ' ", "Because I'm unhappy again; ", "that's why.' ' ", "Well, I'd rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.' ", "'I like that,' said Bernard bitterly. ' ", "When it's you who were the cause of it all. ", "Refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!' ", "He knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; ", "he admitted inwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the Savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. ", "But in spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, Bernard continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the Savage, to meditate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. ", "Nourishing a grievance against the Arch-Community-Songster was useless; ", "there was no possibility of being revenged on the Chief Bottler or the Assistant Predestinator. ", "As a victim, the Savage possessed, for Bernard, this enormous superiority over the others: ", "that he was accessible. ", "One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies. ", "Bernard's other victim-friend was Helmholtz. ", "When, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which in his prosperity he had not thought it worth his while to preserve, Helmholtz gave it; ", "and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. ", "Touched, Bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity-a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to Helmholtz's character. ", "It was the Helmholtz of daily life who forgot and forgave, not the Helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. ", "Bernard was duly grateful (it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful (it would be a pleasure to take some revenge on Helmholtz for his generosity.) ", "At their first meeting after the estrangement, Bernard poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. ", "It was not till some days later that he learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. ", "Helmholtz had also come into conflict with Authority. ' ", "It was over some rhymes,' he explained. ' ", "I was giving my usual course of Advanced Emotional Engineering for Third Year Students. ", "Twelve lectures, of which the seventh is about rhymes. ", "\" On the Use of Rhymes in Moral Propaganda and Advertisement,\" to be precise. ", "I always illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. ", "This time I thought I'd give them one I'd just written myself. ", "Pure madness, of course; ", "but I couldn't resist it.' ", "He laughed. ' ", "I was curious to see what their reactions would be. ", "Besides,' he added more gravely, 'I wanted to do a bit of propaganda; ", "I was trying to engineer them into feeling as I'd felt when I wrote the rhymes. ", "Ford!' ", "He laughed again. ' ", "What an outcry there was! ", "The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. ", "I'm a marked man.' ' ", "But what were your rhymes?' ", "Bernard asked. ' ", "They were about being alone.' ", "Bernard's eyebrows went up. ' ", "I'll recite them to you, if you like.' ", "And Helmholtz began: ", " 'Yesterday's committee, Sticks, but a broken drum, Midnight in the City, Flutes in a vacuum, Shut lips, sleeping faces, Every stopped machine, The dumb and littered places Where crowds have been", "All silences rejoice, Weep (loudly or low), Speak-but with the voice Of whom, I do not know. ", "Absence, say, of Susan's, Absence of Egeria's Arms and respective bosoms, Lips and, ah, posteriors, Slowly form a presence; ", "Whose? and, I ask, of what So absurd an essence, That something, which is not, Nevertheless should populate Empty night more solidly Than that with which we copulate, Why should it seem so squalidly? ", "Well, I gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the Principal.' ", "'I'm not surprised,' said Bernard. ' ", "It's flatly against all their sleep-teaching. ", "Remember, they've had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.' ' ", "I know. ", "But I thought I'd like to see what the effect would be.' ' ", "Well, you've seen now.' ", "Helmholtz only laughed. ' ", "I feel,' he said, after a silence, 'as though I were just beginning to have something to write about. ", "As though I were beginning to be able to use that power I feel I've got inside me-that extra, latent power. ", "Something seems to be coming to me.' ", "In spite of all his troubles, he seemed, Bernard thought, profoundly happy. ", "Helmholtz and the Savage took to one another at once. ", "So cordially indeed that Bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. ", "In all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the Savage as Helmholtz immediately achieved. ", "Watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. ", "He was ashamed of his jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. ", "But the efforts were not very successful; ", "and between the soma-holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. ", "The odious sentiment kept on returning. ", "At his third meeting with the Savage, Helmholtz recited his rhymes on Solitude. ' ", "What do you think of them?' ", "he asked when he had done. ", "The Savage shook his head. ' ", "Listen to this,' was his answer; ", "and unlocking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read: ", " 'Let the bird of loudest lay, On the sole Arabian tree, Herald sad and trumpet be... ", "Helmholtz listened with a growing excitement. ", "At 'sole Arabian tree' he started; ", "at 'thou shrieking harbinger' he smiled with sudden pleasure; ", "at 'every fowl of tyrant wing' the blood rushed up into his cheeks; ", "but at 'defunctive music' he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion. ", "The Savage read on: ", " 'Property was thus appall'd, That the self was not the same; ", "Single nature's double name Neither two nor one was call'd. ", "Reason in itself confounded Saw division grow together... ", "'Orgy-porgy!' said Bernard, interrupting the reading with a loud, unpleasant laugh. ' ", "It's just a Solidarity Service hymn.' ", "He was revenging himself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him. ", "In the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently repeated this little act of vengeance. ", "It was simple and, since both Helmholtz and the Savage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal, extremely effective. ", "In the end, Helmholtz threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. ", "And yet, strangely enough, the next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from Helmholtz himself. ", "The Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet aloud-reading (for all the time he was seeing himself as Romeo and Lenina as Juliet) with an intense and quivering passion. ", "Helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers' first meeting with a puzzled interest. ", "The scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry; ", "but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. ", "Getting into such a state about having a girl-it seemed rather ridiculous. ", "But, taken detail by verbal detail, what a superb piece of emotional engineering! ' ", "That old fellow,' he said, 'he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.' ", "The Savage smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. ", "All went tolerably well until, in the last scene of the third act, Capulet and Lady Capulet began to bully Juliet to marry Paris. ", "Helmholtz had been restless throughout the entire scene; ", "but when, pathetically mimed by the Savage, Juliet cried out: ", " 'Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my grief? ", "O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! ", "Delay this marriage for a month, a week; ", "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies... ", "when Juliet said this, Helmholtz broke out in an explosion of uncontrollable guffawing. ", "The mother and father (grotesque obscenity) forcing the daughter to have some one she didn't want! ", "And the idiotic girl not saying that she was having some one else whom (for the moment, at any rate) she preferred! ", "In its smutty absurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. ", "He had managed, with a heroic effort, to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity; ", "but 'sweet mother' (in the Savage's tremulous tone of anguish) and the reference to Tybalt lying dead, but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a dim monument, were too much for him. ", "He laughed and laughed till the tears streamed down his face-quenchlessly laughed while, pale with a sense of outrage, the Savage looked at him over the top of his book and then, as the laughter still continued, closed it indignantly, got up and, with the gesture of one who removes his pearl from before swine, locked it away in its drawer. ' ", "And yet,' said Helmholtz when, having recovered breath enough to apologize, he had mollified the Savage into listening to his explanations, 'I know quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; ", "one can't write really well about anything else. ", "Why was that old fellow such a marvellous propaganda technician? ", "Because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. ", "You've got to be hurt and upset; ", "otherwise you can't think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases. ", "But fathers and mothers!' ", "He shook his head. ' ", "You can't expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and mothers. ", "And who's going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not having her?' ", "( The Savage winced; ", "but Helmholtz, who was staring pensively at the floor, saw nothing.) ", "' No,' he concluded, with a sigh, 'it won't do. ", "We need some other kind of madness and violence. ", "But what? ", "What? ", "Where can one find it?' ", "He was silent; ", "then, shaking his head, 'I don't know,' he said at last, 'I don't know.' ", "Chapter XIII   ", "Henry Foster loomed up through the twilight of the Embryo Store. ' ", "Like to come to a feely this evening?' ", "Lenina shook her head without speaking. ' ", "Going out with some one else?'

", "Henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crimson mouth. ' ", "You're not feeling ill, are you?' ", "he asked, a trifle anxiously, afraid that she might be suffering from one of the few remaining infectious diseases. ", "Yet once more Lenina shook her head. ' ", "Anyhow, you ought to go and see the doctor,' said Henry. ' ", "A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away,' he added heartily, driving home his hypnop\u00e6dic adage with a clap on the shoulder. ' ", "Perhaps you need a Pregnancy Substitute,' he suggested. ' ", "Or else an extra-strong V.P.S. treatment. ", "Sometimes, you know, the standard passion-surrogate isn't quite...

", " 'Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears, and sometimes voices.' ", "The Savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. ' ", "Have you read it too?' ", "he asked. ' ", "I thought nobody knew about that book here, in England.' ' ", "Almost nobody. ", "I'm one of the very few. ", "It's prohibited, you see. ", "But as I make the laws here, I can also break them. ", "With impunity, Mr. Marx,' he added, turning to Bernard. ' ", "Which I'm afraid you can't do.' ", "Bernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery. ' ", "But why is it prohibited?' asked the Savage. ", "In the excitement of meeting a man who had read Shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else. ", "The Controller shrugged his shoulders. ' ", "Because it's old; ", "that's the chief reason. ", "We haven't any use for old things here.' ", "Even when they're beautiful?' ' ", "Particularly when they're beautiful. ", "Beauty's attractive, and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. ", "We want them to like the new ones.' ' ", "But the new ones are so stupid and horrible.

", "Only in Othello's words could he find an adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred. ' ", "Nice tame animals, anyhow,' the Controller murmured parenthetically. ' ", "Why don't you let them see Othello instead?' ", "'I've told you; ", "it's old. ", "Besides, they couldn't understand it.' ", "Yes, that was true.

", "That's what we've all been wanting to write,' said Helmholtz, breaking a long silence. ' ", "And it's what you never will write,' said the Controller.

", "He passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at the assembling tables, those queued-up twin-herds at the entrance to the Brentford monorail station, those human maggots swarming round Linda's bed of death, the endlessly repeated face of his assailants.

", "Even after decanting, he's still inside a bottle-an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. ", "Each one of us, of course,' the Controller meditatively continued, 'goes through life inside a bottle. ", "But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are, relatively speaking, enormous. ", "We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. ", "You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. ", "It's obvious theoretically. ", "But it has also been proved in actual practice. ", "The result of the Cyprus experiment was convincing.' ' ", "What was that?' asked the Savage. ", "Mustapha Mond smiled. ' ", "Well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. ", "It began in A.F. 473. ", "The Controllers had the island of Cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand Alphas. ", "All agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. ", "The result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. ", "The land wasn't properly worked; ", "there were strikes in all the factories; ", "the laws were set at naught, ", "orders disobeyed; ", "all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. ", "Within six years they were having a first-class civil war. ", "When nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the World Controllers to resume the government of the island. ", "Which they did. ", "And that was the end of the only society of Alphas that the world has ever seen.' ", "The Savage sighed, profoundly. ' ", "The optimum population,' said Mustapha Mond, 'is modelled on the iceberg-eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.' ", "And they're happy below the water line?' ' ", "Happier than above it. ", "Happier than your friends here, for example.' ", "He pointed. ' ", "In spite of that awful work?' ", "Awful? ", "They don't find it so. ", "On the contrary, they like it. ", "It's light, it's childishly simple. ", "No strain on the mind or the muscles. ", "Seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. ", "What more can they ask for? ", "True,' he added, 'they might ask for shorter hours. ", "And of course we could give them shorter hours. ", "Technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. ", "But would they be any the happier for that? ", "No, they wouldn't. ", "The experiment was tried, more than a century and a half ago. ", "The whole of Ireland was put on to the four-hour day. ", "What was the result? ", "Unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; ", "that was all. ", "Those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take a holiday from them. ", "The Inventions Office is stuffed with plans for labour-saving processes. ", "Thousands of them.' ", "Mustapha Mond made a lavish gesture. ' ", "And why don't we put them into execution? ", "For the sake of the labourers; ", "it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with excessive leisure. ", "It's the same with agriculture. ", "We could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. ", "But we don't. ", "We prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. ", "For their own sakes-because it takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. ", "Besides, we have our stability to think of. ", "We don't want to change. ", "Every change is a menace to stability. ", "That's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. ", "Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; ", "even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. ", "Yes, even science.' ", "Science? ", "The Savage frowned. ", "He knew the word. ", "But what it exactly signified he could not say. ", "Shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science, and from Linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints: ", "science was something you made helicopters with, something that caused you to laugh at the Corn Dances, something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. ", "He made a desperate effort to take the Controller's meaning. ' ", "Yes,' Mustapha Mond was saying, 'that's another item in the cost of stability. ", "It isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; ", "it's also science. ", "Science is dangerous; ", "we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.' ' ", "What?' said Helmholtz, in astonishment. ' ", "But we're always saying that science is everything. ", "It's a hypnop\u00e6dic platitude.' ' ", "Three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,' put in Bernard. ' ", "And all the science propaganda we do at the College... ", " 'Yes; ", "but what sort of science?' asked Mustapha Mond sarcastically. ' ", "You've had no scientific training, so you can't judge. ", "I was a pretty good physicist in my time. ", "Too good-good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook. ", "I'm the head cook now. ", "But I was an inquisitive young scullion once. ", "I started doing a bit of cooking on my own. ", "Unorthodox cooking, illicit cooking. ", "A bit of real science, in fact.' ", "He was silent. ' ", "What happened?' asked Helmholtz Watson. ", "The Controller sighed. ' ", "Very nearly what's going to happen to you young men. ", "I was on the point of being sent to an island.' ", "The words galvanized Bernard into a violent and unseemly activity. ' ", "Send me to an island?' ", "He jumped up, ran across the room, and stood gesticulating in front of the Controller. ' ", "You can't send me. ", "I haven't done anything. ", "It was the others. ", "I swear it was the others.' ", "He pointed accusingly to Helmholtz and the Savage. ' ", "Oh, please don't send me to Iceland. ", "I promise I'll do what I ought to do. ", "Give me another chance. ", "Please give me another chance.' ", "The tears began to flow. ' ", "I tell you, it's their fault,' he sobbed. ' ", "And not to Iceland. ", "Oh, please, your fordship, please... ", "And in a paroxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the Controller. ", "Mustapha Mond tried to make him get up; ", "but Bernard persisted in his grovelling; ", "the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. ", "In the end the Controller had to ring for his fourth secretary. ' ", "Bring three men,' he ordered, 'and take Mr. Marx into a bedroom. ", "Give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.' ", "The fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-uniformed twin footmen. ", "Still shouting and sobbing, Bernard was carried out. ' ", "One would think he was going to have his throat cut,' said the Controller, as the door closed. ' ", "Whereas, if he had the smallest sense, he'd understand that his punishment is really a reward. ", "He's being sent to an island. ", "That's to say, he's being sent to a place where he'll meet the most interesting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. ", "All the people who, for one reason or another, have got too self-consciously individual to fit into community-life. ", "All the people who aren't satisfied with orthodoxy, who've got independent ideas of their own. ", "Every one, in a word, who's any one. ", "I almost envy you, Mr. Watson.' ", "Helmholtz laughed. ' ", "Then why aren't you on an island yourself?' ' ", "Because, finally, I preferred this,' the Controller answered. ' ", "I was given the choice: ", "to be sent to an island, where I could have got on with my pure science, or to be taken on to the Controllers' Council with the prospect of succeeding in due course to an actual Controllership. ", "I chose this and let the science go.' ", "After a little silence, 'Sometimes,' he added, 'I rather regret the science. ", "Happiness is a hard master-particularly other people's happiness. ", "A much harder master, if one isn't conditioned to accept it unquestioningly, than truth.' ", "He sighed, fell silent again, then continued in a brisker tone. ' ", "Well, duty's duty. ", "One can't consult one's own preferences. ", "I'm interested in truth, I like science. ", "But truth's a menace, science is a public danger. ", "As dangerous as it's been beneficent. ", "It has given us the stablest equilibrium in history. ", "China's was hopelessly insecure by comparison; ", "even the primitive matriarchies weren't steadier than we are. ", "Thanks, I repeat, to science. ", "But we can't allow science to undo its own good work. ", "That's why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches-that's why I almost got sent to an island. ", "We don't allow it to deal with any but the most immediate problems of the moment. ", "All other enquiries are most sedulously discouraged. ", "It's curious,' he went on after a little pause, 'to read what people in the time of Our Ford used to write about scientific progress. ", "They seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. ", "Knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; ", "all the rest was secondary and subordinate. ", "True, ideas were beginning to change even then. ", "Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. ", "Mass production demanded the shift. ", "Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; ", "truth and beauty can't. ", "And, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. ", "Still, in spite of everything, unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. ", "People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods. ", "Right up to the time of the Nine Years' War. ", "That made them change their tune all right. ", "What's the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you? ", "That was when science first began to be controlled-after the Nine Years' War. ", "People were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. ", "Anything for a quiet life. ", "We've gone on controlling ever since. ", "It hasn't been very good for truth, of course. ", "But it's been very good for happiness. ", "One can't have something for nothing. ", "Happiness has got to be paid for. ", "You're paying for it, Mr. Watson-paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. ", "I was too much interested in truth; ", "I paid too.' ' ", "But you didn't go to an island,' said the Savage, breaking a long silence. ", "The Controller smiled. ' ", "That's how I paid. ", "By choosing to serve happiness. ", "Other people's-not mine. ", "It's lucky,' he added, after a pause, 'that there are such a lot of islands in the world. ", "I don't know what we should do without them. ", "Put you all in the lethal chamber, I suppose. ", "By the way, Mr. Watson, would you like a tropical climate? ", "The Marquesas, for example; ", "or Samoa? ", "Or something rather more bracing?' ", "Helmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. ' ", "I should like a thoroughly bad climate,' he answered. ' ", "I believe one would write better if the climate were bad. ", "If there were a lot of wind and storms, for example... ", "The Controller nodded his approbation. ' ", "I like your spirit, Mr. Watson. ", "I like it very much indeed. ", "As much as I officially disapprove of it.' ", "He smiled. ' ", "What about the Falkland Islands?' ", "Yes, I think that will do,' Helmholtz answered. ' ", "And now, if you don't mind, I'll go and see how poor Bernard's getting on.' ", "Chapter XVII  'Art, science-you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your happiness,' said the Savage, when they were alone. ' ", "Anything else?' ' ", "Well, religion, of course,' replied the Controller. ' ", "There used to be something called God-before the Nine Years' War. ", "But I was forgetting; ", "you know all about God, I suppose.' ' ", "Well... ", "The Savage hesitated. ", "He would have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. ", "He would have liked to speak; ", "but there were no words. ", "Not even in Shakespeare. ", "The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe let into the wall between the bookshelves. ", "The heavy door swung open. ", "Rummaging in the darkness within, 'It's a subject,' he said, 'that has always had a great interest for me.' ", "He pulled out a thick black volume. ' ", "You've never read this, for example.' ", "The Savage took it. ' ", "The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments,' he read aloud from the title-page. ' ", "Nor this.' ", "It was a small book and had lost its cover. ' ", "The Imitation of Christ.' ' ", "Nor this.' ", "He handed out another volume. ' ", "The Varieties of Religious Experience. ", "By William James.' ", "And I've got plenty more,' Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. ' ", "A whole collection of pornographic old books. ", "God in the safe and Ford on the shelves.' ", "He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library-to the shelves of books, the racks full of reading-machine bobbins and sound-track rolls. ' ", "But if you know about God, why don't you tell them?' asked the Savage indignantly. ' ", "Why don't you give them these books about God?' ' ", "For the same reason as we don't give them Othello: ", "they're old; ", "they're about God hundreds of years ago. ", "Not about God now.' ' ", "But God doesn't change.' ' ", "Men do, though.' ' ", "What difference does that make?' ' ", "All the difference in the world,' said Mustapha Mond. ", "He got up again and walked to the safe. ' ", "There was a man called Cardinal Newman,' he said. ' ", "A cardinal,' he exclaimed parenthetically, 'was a kind of Arch-Community-Songster.' ' ", "\"I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal. ", "\" I've read about them in Shakespeare.' ' ", "Of course you have. ", "Well, as I was saying, there was a man called Cardinal Newman. ", "Ah, here's the book.' ", "He pulled it out. ' ", "And while I'm about it I'll take this one too. ", "It's by a man called Maine de Biran. ", "He was a philosopher, if you know what that was.' ' ", "A man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,' said the Savage promptly. ' ", "Quite so. ", "I'll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. ", "Meanwhile, listen to what this old Arch-Community-Songster said.' ", "He opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. ' ", "\" We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. ", "We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. ", "We are not our own masters. ", "We are God's property. ", "Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? ", "Is it any happiness, or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? ", "It may be thought so by the young and prosperous. ", "These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way-to depend on no one-to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. ", "But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man-that it is an unnatural state-will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end... ", "' Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. ' ", "Take this, for example,' he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: ", "'\"A man grows old; ", "he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; ", "and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. ", "Vain imaginings! ", "That sickness is old age; ", "and a horrible disease it is. ", "They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. ", "But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; ", "to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; ", "whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; ", "our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; ", "turns naturally and inevitably; ", "for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charm has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false-a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. ", "Yes, we inevitably turn to God; ", "for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.\" ", "' Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. ' ", "One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this' (he waved his hand), 'us, the modern world. ", "\" You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity; ", "independence won't take you safely to the end. ", "\" Well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. ", "What follows? ", "Evidently, that we can be independent of God. ", "\" The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.\" ", "But there aren't any losses for us to compensate; ", "religious sentiment is superfluous. ", "And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? ", "A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? ", "What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?' ' ", "Then you think there is no God?' ", "No, I think there quite probably is one.' ' ", "Then why?... ", "Mustapha Mond checked him. ' ", "But he manifests himself in different ways to different men. ", "In pre-modern times he manifested himself as the being that's described in these books. ", "Now... ", " 'How does he manifest himself now?' asked the Savage. ' ", "Well, he manifests himself as an absence; ", "as though he weren't there at all.' ", "'That's your fault.' ' ", "Call it the fault of civilization. ", "God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. ", "You must make your choice. ", "Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness. ", "That's why I have to keep these books locked up in the safe. ", "They're smut. ", "People would be shocked if... ", "The Savage interrupted him. ' ", "But isn't it natural to feel there's a God?' ", "'You might as well ask if it's natural to do up one's trousers with zippers,' said the Controller sarcastically. ' ", "You remind me of another of those old fellows called Bradley. ", "He defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. ", "As if one believed anything by instinct! ", "One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. ", "Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons-that's philosophy. ", "People believe in God because they've been conditioned to believe in God.' ' ", "But all the same,' insisted the Savage, 'it is natural to believe in God when you're alone-quite alone, in the night, thinking about death... ", "'  ' ", "But people never are alone now,' said Mustapha Mond. ", "We make them hate solitude; ", "and we arrange their lives so that it's almost impossible for them ever to have it.' ", "The Savage nodded gloomily. ", "At Malpais he had suffered because they had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civilized London he was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities, never be quietly alone. ' ", "Do you remember that bit in King Lear?' said the Savage at last: ", "'\"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us; ", "the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes,\" and Edmund answers-you remember, he's wounded, he's dying-\"Thou hast spoken right; ", "'tis true.

'Are you sure?' asked the Savage. ' ", "Are you quite sure that the Edmund in that pneumatic chair hasn't been just as heavily punished as the Edmund who's wounded and bleeding to death? ", "The gods are just. ", "Haven't they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?' ' ", "Degrade him from what position? ", "As a happy, hard-working, goods-consuming citizen he's perfect. ", "Of course, if you choose some other standard than ours, then perhaps you might say he was degraded.

", "Roughly parallel to it, the up-line passed over Worplesden, Tongham, Puttenham, Elstead and Grayshott.

", "The distance was too small for careless flyers-particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. ", "There had been accidents. ", "Serious ones. ", "It had been decided to deflect the up-line a few kilometres to the west. ", "Between Grayshott and Tongham four abandoned air-lighthouses marked the course of the old Portsmouth-to-London road. ", "The skies above them were silent and deserted. ", "It was over Selborne, Borden and Farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared. ", "The Savage had chosen as his hermitage the old lighthouse which stood on the crest of the hill between Puttenham and Elstead. ", "The building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition-almost too comfortable, the Savage had thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly luxurious. ", "He pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. ", "His first night in the hermitage was, deliberately, a sleepless one. ", "He spent the hours on his knees praying, now to that Heaven from which the guilty Claudius had begged forgiveness, now in Zu\u00f1i to Awonawilona, now to Jesus and Pookong, now to his own guardian animal, the eagle. ", "From time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the cross, and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony; ", "held them, in voluntary crucifixion, while he repeated, through clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), 'Oh, forgive me! ", "Oh, make me pure! ", "Oh, help me to be good!' ", "again and again, till he was on the point of fainting from the pain. ", "When morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse: ", "yes, even though there still was glass in most of the windows, even though the view from the platform was so fine. ", "For the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going somewhere else. ", "He had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. ", "But who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness? ", "Who was he to be living in the visible presence of God? ", "All he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind hole in the ground. ", "Stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but for that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his tower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the right to inhabit. ", "On the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the Hog's Back, from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted Guildford. ", "Seeing them, the Savage made a grimace; ", "but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; ", "for at night they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else, flood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose significance nobody in England but the Savage now understood) solemnly towards the plumbless mysteries of heaven. ", "In the valley which separated the Hog's Back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood, Puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high, with silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-D factory. ", "On the other side of the lighthouse, towards the south, the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds. ", "Beyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of Elstead. ", "Dim in the hazy English air, Hindhead and Selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. ", "But it was not alone the distance that had attracted the Savage to his lighthouse; ", "the near was as seductive as the far. ", "The woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of Scotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water lilies, their beds of rushes-these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the American desert, astonishing. ", "And then the solitude! ", "Whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. ", "The lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour's flight from the Charing-T Tower; ", "but the hills of Malpais were hardly more deserted than this Surrey heath. ", "The crowds that daily left London left it only to play Electro-magnetic Golf or Tennis. ", "Puttenham possessed no links; ", "the nearest Riemann-surfaces were at Guildford. ", "Flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. ", "And so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. ", "During the first days the Savage lived alone and undisturbed. ", "Of the money which, on his first arrival, John had received for his personal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. ", "Before leaving London he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. ' ", "No, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,' he had insisted. ' ", "Even though it is more nourishing.' ", "But when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to resist the shopman's persuasion. ", "Looking at the tins now, he bitterly reproached himself for his weakness. ", "Loathsome civilized stuff! ", "He had made up his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. ' ", "That'll teach them,' he thought vindictively. ", "It would also teach him. ", "He counted his money. ", "The little that remained would be enough, he hoped, to tide him over the winter. ", "By next spring, his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. ", "Meanwhile, there would always be game. ", "He had seen plenty of rabbits, and there were water-fowl on the ponds. ", "He set to work at once to make a bow and arrows. ", "There were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. ", "He began by felling a young ash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by paring, shaved away the white wood, as old Mitsima had taught him, until he had a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick at the slender tips. ", "The work gave him an intense pleasure. ", "After those weeks of idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience. ", "He had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he realized with a start that he was singing-singing! ", "It was as though, stumbling upon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. ", "Guiltily he blushed. ", "After all, it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. ", "It was to escape further contamination by the filth of civilized life; ", "it was to be purified and made good; ", "it was actively to make amends. ", "He realized to his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember-poor Linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the very gods themselves. ", "He had sworn to remember, he had sworn unceasingly to make amends. ", "And here was he, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing, actually singing....   ", "He went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire. ", "Half an hour later, three Delta-Minus land-workers from one of the Puttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. ", "His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. ", "The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. ", "One, two, three-they counted the strokes. ", "After the eighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood's edge and there be violently sick. ", "When he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. ", "Nine, ten, eleven, twelve... ", " 'Ford!' whispered the driver. ", "And his twins were of the same opinion. ' ", "Fordey!' ", "they said. ", "Three days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters came. ", "Dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. ", "The Savage was busy on his arrows. ", "Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. ", "He had made a raid one night on the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. ", "It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. ", "Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him. ' ", "Good-morning, Mr. Savage,' he said. ' ", "I am the representative of The Hourly Radio.' ", "Startled as though by the bite of a snake, the Savage sprang to his feet, scattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions. ' ", "I beg your pardon,' said the reporter, with genuine compunction. ", "I had no intention... ", "He touched his hat-the aluminium stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. ' ", "Excuse my not taking it off,' he said. ' ", "It's a bit heavy. ", "Well, as I was saying, I am the representative of The Hourly... ", " 'What do you want?' asked the Savage, scowling. ", "The reporter returned his most ingratiating smile. ' ", "Well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested... ", "He put his head on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. ' ", "Just a few words from you, Mr. Savage.' ", "And rapidly, with a series of ritual gestures, he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; ", "plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminium hat; ", "touched a spring on the crown-and antenn\u00e6 shot up into the air; ", "touched another spring on the peak of the brim-and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung there, quivering, six inches in front of his nose; ", "pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears; ", "pressed a switch on the left side of the hat-and from within came a faint waspy buzzing; ", "turned a knob on the right-and the buzzing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and crackle, by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. ' ", "Hullo,' he said to the microphone, 'hullo, hullo... ", "A bell suddenly rang inside his hat. ' ", "Is that you, Edzel? ", "Primo Mellon speaking. ", "Yes, I've got hold of him. ", "Mr. Savage will now take the microphone and say a few words. ", "Won't you, Mr. Savage?' ", "He looked up at the Savage with another of those winning smiles of his.

", "And seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller, delivered a most prodigious kick.

", "At the sight of the young woman, the Savage started, recoiled, turned pale. ", "The young woman stood, smiling at him-an uncertain, imploring, almost abject smile. ", "The seconds passed. ", "Her lips moved, she was saying something; ", "but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the sightseers. ' ", "We-want-the whip! ", "We-want-the whip!' ", "The young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous expression of yearning distress. ", "Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; ", "and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. ", "Inaudibly, she spoke again; ", "then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the Savage, stepped forward. ' ", "We-want-the whip! ", "We-want...

", "This time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. ' ", "Kill it, kill it!' ", "Drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled by that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Savage struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet.

", "He walked down the gallery and across the narrow \"bridges\" which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. ", "He had been seated before the door of the main house. ", "The parrot and the mocking-bird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished.

", "The main building was called \"the house,\" to distinguish it from the cottages. ", "The chattering and whistling birds were still at it. ", "Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from \"Zampa\" upon the piano. ", "Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside.

", "\"You are burnt beyond recognition,\" he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage.

", "They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. ", "He yawned and stretched himself. ", "Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.

", "There rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance. ", "His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day. ", "Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette.

", "He was very young, and did not know any better. ", "Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason. ", "Each was interested in what the other said. ", "Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him. ", "He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there. ", "Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent. ", "He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at Grand Isle. ", "In former times, before Robert could remember, \"the house\" had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. ", "Now, flanked by its dozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the \"Quartier Francais,\" it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright. ", "Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky blue-grass country. ", "She was an American woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution. ", "She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married. ", "Robert was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead. ", "When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner. ", "\"I see Leonce isn't coming back,\" she said, with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared. ", "Robert supposed he was not, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein's. ", "When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where, during the half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the little Pontellier children, who were very fond of him. ", "III    ", "It was eleven o'clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein's hotel. ", "He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very talkative. ", "His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in. ", "He talked to her while he undressed, telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day. ", "From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin, which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and whatever else happened to be in his pockets. ", "She was overcome with sleep, and answered him with little half utterances. ", "He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him, and valued so little his conversation. ", "Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys. ", "Notwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining room where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting comfortably. ", "The result of his investigation was far from satisfactory. ", "He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed. ", "One of them began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs. ", "Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had a high fever and needed looking after. ", "Then he lit a cigar and went and sat near the open door to smoke it. ", "Mrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever. ", "He had gone to bed perfectly well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day. ", "Mr. Pontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken. ", "He assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room. ", "He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the children. ", "If it was not a mother's place to look after children, whose on earth was it? ", "He himself had his hands full with his brokerage business. ", "He could not be in two places at once; ", "making a living for his family on the street, and staying at home to see that no harm befell them. ", "He talked in a monotonous, insistent way. ", "Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room. ", "She soon came back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the pillow. ", "She said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he questioned her. ", "When his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in half a minute he was fast asleep. ", "Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. ", "She began to cry a little, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir. ", "Blowing out the candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare feet into a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch, where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock gently to and fro. ", "It was then past midnight. ", "The cottages were all dark. ", "A single faint light gleamed out from the hallway of the house. ", "There was no sound abroad except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and the everlasting voice of the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft hour. ", "It broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night. ", "The tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier's eyes that the damp sleeve of her peignoir no longer served to dry them. ", "She was holding the back of her chair with one hand; ", "her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the shoulder of her uplifted arm. ", "Turning, she thrust her face, steaming and wet, into the bend of her arm, and she went on crying there, not caring any longer to dry her face, her eyes, her arms. ", "She could not have told why she was crying. ", "Such experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon in her married life. ", "They seemed never before to have weighed much against the abundance of her husband's kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and self-understood. ", "An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. ", "It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. ", "It was strange and unfamiliar; ", "it was a mood. ", "She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. ", "She was just having a good cry all to herself. ", "The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. ", "The little stinging, buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which might have held her there in the darkness half a night longer. ", "The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the rockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf. ", "He was returning to the city to his business, and they would not see him again at the Island till the coming Saturday. ", "He had regained his composure, which seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before. ", "He was eager to be gone, as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet Street. ", "Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away from Klein's hotel the evening before. ", "She liked money as well as most women, and accepted it with no little satisfaction. ", "\"It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!\" ", "she exclaimed, smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one. ", "\"Oh! we'll treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,\" he laughed, as he prepared to kiss her good-by. ", "The boys were tumbling about, clinging to his legs, imploring that numerous things be brought back to them. ", "Mr. Pontellier was a great favorite, and ladies, men, children, even nurses, were always on hand to say good-by to him. ", "His wife stood smiling and waving, the boys shouting, as he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road. ", "A few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans. ", "It was from her husband. ", "It was filled with friandises, with luscious and toothsome bits-the finest of fruits, pates, a rare bottle or two, delicious syrups, and bonbons in abundance. ", "Mrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a box; ", "she was quite used to receiving them when away from home. ", "The pates and fruit were brought to the dining-room; ", "the bonbons were passed around. ", "And the ladies, selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers and a little greedily, all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best husband in the world. ", "Mrs. Pontellier was forced to admit that she knew of none better. ", "IV    ", "It would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to his own satisfaction or any one else's wherein his wife failed in her duty toward their children. ", "It was something which he felt rather than perceived, and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and ample atonement. ", "If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he was not apt to rush crying to his mother's arms for comfort; ", "he would more likely pick himself up, wipe the water out of his eyes and the sand out of his mouth, and go on playing. ", "Tots as they were, they pulled together and stood their ground in childish battles with doubled fists and uplifted voices, which usually prevailed against the other mother-tots. ", "The quadroon nurse was looked upon as a huge encumbrance, only good to button up waists and panties and to brush and part hair; ", "since it seemed to be a law of society that hair must be parted and brushed. ", "In short, Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman. ", "The mother-women seemed to prevail that summer at Grand Isle. ", "It was easy to know them, fluttering about with extended, protecting wings when any harm, real or imaginary, threatened their precious brood. ", "They were women who idolized their children, worshiped their husbands, and esteemed it a holy privilege to efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as ministering angels. ", "Many of them were delicious in the role; ", "one of them was the embodiment of every womanly grace and charm. ", "If her husband did not adore her, he was a brute, deserving of death by slow torture. ", "Her name was Adele Ratignolle. ", "There are no words to describe her save the old ones that have served so often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the fair lady of our dreams. ", "There was nothing subtle or hidden about her charms; ", "her beauty was all there, flaming and apparent: ", "the spun-gold hair that comb nor confining pin could restrain; ", "the blue eyes that were like nothing but sapphires; ", "two lips that pouted, that were so red one could only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in looking at them. ", "She was growing a little stout, but it did not seem to detract an iota from the grace of every step, pose, gesture. ", "One would not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms more slender. ", "Never were hands more exquisite than hers, and it was a joy to look at them when she threaded her needle or adjusted her gold thimble to her taper middle finger as she sewed away on the little night-drawers or fashioned a bodice or a bib. ", "Madame Ratignolle was very fond of Mrs. Pontellier, and often she took her sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons. ", "She was sitting there the afternoon of the day the box arrived from New Orleans. ", "She had possession of the rocker, and she was busily engaged in sewing upon a diminutive pair of night-drawers. ", "She had brought the pattern of the drawers for Mrs. Pontellier to cut out-a marvel of construction, fashioned to enclose a baby's body so effectually that only two small eyes might look out from the garment, like an Eskimo's. ", "They were designed for winter wear, when treacherous drafts came down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found their way through key-holes. ", "Mrs. Pontellier's mind was quite at rest concerning the present material needs of her children, and she could not see the use of anticipating and making winter night garments the subject of her summer meditations. ", "But she did not want to appear unamiable and uninterested, so she had brought forth newspapers, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and under Madame Ratignolle's directions she had cut a pattern of the impervious garment. ", "Robert was there, seated as he had been the Sunday before, and Mrs. Pontellier also occupied her former position on the upper step, leaning listlessly against the post. ", "Beside her was a box of bonbons, which she held out at intervals to Madame Ratignolle. ", "That lady seemed at a loss to make a selection, but finally settled upon a stick of nougat, wondering if it were not too rich; ", "whether it could possibly hurt her. ", "Madame Ratignolle had been married seven years. ", "About every two years she had a baby. ", "At that time she had three babies, and was beginning to think of a fourth one. ", "She was always talking about her \"condition.\" ", "Her \"condition\" was in no way apparent, and no one would have known a thing about it ", "but for her persistence in making it the subject of conversation. ", "Robert started to reassure her, asserting that he had known a lady who had subsisted upon nougat during the entire-but seeing the color mount into Mrs. Pontellier's face he checked himself and changed the subject. ", "Mrs. Pontellier, though she had married a Creole, was not thoroughly at home in the society of Creoles; ", "never before had she been thrown so intimately among them. ", "There were only Creoles that summer at Lebrun's. ", "They all knew each other, and felt like one large family, among whom existed the most amicable relations. ", "A characteristic which distinguished them and which impressed Mrs. Pontellier most forcibly was their entire absence of prudery. ", "Their freedom of expression was at first incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty in reconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the Creole woman seems to be inborn and unmistakable. ", "Never would Edna Pontellier forget the shock with which she heard Madame Ratignolle relating to old Monsieur Farival the harrowing story of one of her accouchements, withholding no intimate detail. ", "She was growing accustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting color back from her cheeks. ", "Oftener than once her coming had interrupted the droll story with which Robert was entertaining some amused group of married women. ", "A book had gone the rounds of the pension. ", "When it came her turn to read it, she did so with profound astonishment. ", "She felt moved to read the book in secret and solitude, though none of the others had done so,-to hide it from view at the sound of approaching footsteps. ", "It was openly criticised and freely discussed at table. ", "Mrs. Pontellier gave over being astonished, and concluded that wonders would never cease. ", "V   They formed a congenial group sitting there that summer afternoon-Madame Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a story or incident with much expressive gesture of her perfect hands; ", "Robert and Mrs. Pontellier sitting idle, exchanging occasional words, glances or smiles which indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy and camaraderie. ", "He had lived in her shadow during the past month. ", "No one thought anything of it. ", "Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to Mrs. Pontellier when he arrived. ", "Since the age of fifteen, which was eleven years before, Robert each summer at Grand Isle had constituted himself the devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel. ", "Sometimes it was a young girl, again a widow; ", "but as often as not it was some interesting married woman. ", "For two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle Duvigne's presence. ", "But she died between summers; ", "then Robert posed as an inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle for whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to vouchsafe. ", "Mrs. Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might look upon a faultless Madonna. \" ", "Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?\" murmured Robert. ", "\" She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. ", "It was 'Robert, come; ", "go; ", "stand up; ", "sit down; ", "do this; ", "do that; ", "see if the baby sleeps; ", "my thimble, please, that I left God knows where. ", "Come and read Daudet to me while I sew.'\" ", "\"Par exemple! ", "I never had to ask. ", "You were always there under my feet, like a troublesome cat.\" ", "\"You mean like an adoring dog. ", "And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared on the scene, then it WAS like a dog. ' ", "Passez! ", "Adieu! ", "Allez vous-en!'\" ", "\"Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,\" she interjoined, with excessive naivete. ", "That made them all laugh. ", "The right hand jealous of the left! ", "The heart jealous of the soul! ", "But for that matter, the Creole husband is never jealous; ", "with him the gangrene passion is one which has become dwarfed by disuse. ", "Meanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his one time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; ", "of sleepless nights, of consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge. ", "While the lady at the needle kept up a little running, contemptuous comment: ", " \"Blagueur-farceur-gros bete, va!\" ", "He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier. ", "She never knew precisely what to make of it; ", "at that moment it was impossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest. ", "It was understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously. ", "Mrs. Pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself. ", "It would have been unacceptable and annoying. ", "Mrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way. ", "She liked the dabbling. ", "She felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her. ", "She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. ", "Never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there like some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid color. ", "Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs. Pontellier, that he might watch her work. ", "She handled her brushes with a certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close acquaintance with them, but from a natural aptitude. ", "Robert followed her work with close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle. ", "Mais ce n'est pas mal! ", "Elle s'y connait, elle a de la force, oui.\" ", "During his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against Mrs. Pontellier's arm. ", "As gently she repulsed him. ", "Once again he repeated the offense. ", "She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part; ", "yet that was no reason she should submit to it. ", "She did not remonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but firmly. ", "He offered no apology. ", "The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle. ", "She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her. ", "But it was a fair enough piece of work, and in many respects satisfying. ", "Mrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so. ", "After surveying the sketch critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and crumpled the paper between her hands. ", "The youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the respectful distance which they required her to observe. ", "Mrs. Pontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house. ", "She sought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry. ", "But they were greatly in earnest. ", "They had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box. ", "They accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them, each holding out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain hope that they might be filled; ", "and then away they went. ", "The sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that came up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea. ", "Children freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the oaks. ", "Their voices were high and penetrating. ", "Madame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and thread all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely. ", "She complained of faintness. ", "Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan. ", "She bathed Madame Ratignolle's face with cologne, while Robert plied the fan with unnecessary vigor. ", "The spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering if there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the rose tint had never faded from her friend's face. ", "She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess. ", "Her little ones ran to meet her. ", "Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms. ", "Though, as everybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin! \" ", "Are you going bathing?\" asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. ", "It was not so much a question as a reminder. ", "\"Oh, no,\" she answered, with a tone of indecision. ", "\" I'm tired; ", "I think not.\" ", "Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty. ", "\"Oh, come!\" ", "he insisted. ", "\" You mustn't miss your bath. ", "Come on. ", "The water must be delicious; ", "it will not hurt you. ", "Come.\" ", "He reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the door, and put it on her head. ", "They descended the steps, and walked away together toward the beach. ", "The sun was low in the west and the breeze was soft and warm. ", "VI   Edna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with Robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses which impelled her. ", "A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,-the light which, showing the way, forbids it. ", "At that early period it served but to bewilder her. ", "It moved her to dreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her the midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears. ", "In short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an individual to the world within and about her. ", "This may seem like a ponderous weight of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of twenty-eight-perhaps more wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased to vouchsafe to any woman. ", "But the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily vague, tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. ", "How few of us ever emerge from such beginning! ", "How many souls perish in its tumult! ", "The voice of the sea is seductive; ", "never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; ", "to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation. ", "The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. ", "The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace. ", "VII   Mrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic hitherto contrary to her nature. ", "Even as a child she had lived her own small life all within herself. ", "At a very early period she had apprehended instinctively the dual life-that outward existence which conforms, the inward life which questions. ", "That summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of reserve that had always enveloped her. ", "There may have been-there must have been-influences, both subtle and apparent, working in their several ways to induce her to do this; ", "but the most obvious was the influence of Adele Ratignolle. ", "The excessive physical charm of the Creole had first attracted her, for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty. ", "Then the candor of the woman's whole existence, which every one might read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own habitual reserve-this might have furnished a link. ", "Who can tell what metals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy, which we might as well call love. ", "The two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm, under the huge white sunshade. ", "Edna had prevailed upon Madame Ratignolle to leave the children behind, though she could not induce her to relinquish a diminutive roll of needlework, which Adele begged to be allowed to slip into the depths of her pocket. ", "In some unaccountable way they had escaped from Robert. ", "The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. ", "There were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. ", "Further away still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening. ", "The dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun. ", "The women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing the more feminine and matronly figure. ", "The charm of Edna Pontellier's physique stole insensibly upon you. ", "The lines of her body were long, clean and symmetrical; ", "it was a body which occasionally fell into splendid poses; ", "there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped fashion-plate about it. ", "A casual and indiscriminating observer, in passing, might not cast a second glance upon the figure. ", "But with more feeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of its modeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement, which made Edna Pontellier different from the crowd. ", "She wore a cool muslin that morning-white, with a waving vertical line of brown running through it; ", "also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door. ", "The hat rested any way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy, and clung close to her head. ", "Madame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze veil about her head. ", "She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that protected her wrists. ", "She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness of ruffles that became her. ", "The draperies and fluttering things which she wore suited her rich, luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line could not have done. ", "There were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid construction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water. ", "Each house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun's possessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential paraphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners might desire. ", "The two women had no intention of bathing; ", "they had just strolled down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the water. ", "The Pontellier and Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another under the same roof. ", "Mrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit. ", "Unlocking the door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged, bringing a rug, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two huge hair pillows covered with crash, which she placed against the front of the building. ", "The two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by side, with their backs against the pillows and their feet extended. ", "Madame Ratignolle removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather delicate handkerchief, and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried suspended somewhere about her person by a long, narrow ribbon. ", "Edna removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat. ", "She took the fan from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion. ", "It was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about the heat, the sun, the glare. ", "But there was a breeze blowing, a choppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. ", "It fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting, readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. ", "A few persons were sporting some distance away in the water. ", "The beach was very still of human sound at that hour. ", "The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bath-house. ", "Two young lovers were exchanging their hearts' yearnings beneath the children's tent, which they had found unoccupied. ", "Edna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest upon the sea. ", "The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went; ", "there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon. ", "A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance. \" ", "Of whom-of what are you thinking?\" asked Adele of her companion, whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention, arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and fixed every feature into a statuesque repose. ", "\"Nothing,\" returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once: ", "\"How stupid! ", "But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to such a question. ", "Let me see,\" she went on, throwing back her head and narrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light. ", "Let me see. ", "I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; ", "but perhaps I can retrace my thoughts.\" ", "\"Oh! never mind!\" laughed Madame Ratignolle. ", "\" I am not quite so exacting. ", "I will let you off this time. ", "It is really too hot to think, especially to think about thinking.\" ", "\"But for the fun of it,\" persisted Edna. \" ", "First of all, the sight of the water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at. ", "The hot wind beating in my face made me think-without any connection that I can trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow that seemed as big as the ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass, which was higher than her waist. ", "She threw out her arms as if swimming when she walked, beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water. ", "Oh, I see the connection now!\" ", "\"Where were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the grass?\" ", "\"I don't remember now. ", "I was just walking diagonally across a big field. ", "My sun-bonnet obstructed the view. ", "I could see only the stretch of green before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to the end of it. ", "I don't remember whether I was frightened or pleased. ", "I must have been entertained. ", "\"Likely as not it was Sunday,\" she laughed; ", "and I was running away from prayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of.\" ", "\"And have you been running away from prayers ever since, ma chere?\" asked Madame Ratignolle, amused. ", "No! ", "oh, no!\" ", "Edna hastened to say. ", "\" I was a little unthinking child in those days, just following a misleading impulse without question. ", "On the contrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me; ", "after I was twelve and until-until-why, I suppose until now, though I never thought much about it-just driven along by habit. ", "But do you know,\" she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion, \"sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through the green meadow again; ", "idly, aimlessly, unthinking and unguided.\" ", "Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was near her. ", "Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly and warmly. ", "She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand, murmuring in an undertone, \"Pauvre cherie. ", "\" The action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent herself readily to the Creole's gentle caress. ", "She was not accustomed to an outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or in others. ", "She and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal through force of unfortunate habit. ", "Her older sister, Margaret, was matronly and dignified, probably from having assumed matronly and housewifely responsibilities too early in life, their mother having died when they were quite young. ", "Margaret was not effusive; ", "she was practical. ", "Edna had had an occasional girl friend, but whether accidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one type-the self-contained. ", "She never realized that the reserve of her own character had much, perhaps everything, to do with this. ", "Her most intimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who wrote fine-sounding essays, which Edna admired and strove to imitate; ", "and with her she talked and glowed over the English classics, and sometimes held religious and political controversies. ", "Edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly disturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her part. ", "At a very early age-perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean of waving grass-she remembered that she had been passionately enamored of a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in Kentucky. ", "She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon's, with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead. ", "But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence. ", "At another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman who visited a lady on a neighboring plantation. ", "It was after they went to Mississippi to live. ", "The young man was engaged to be married to the young lady, and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of afternoons in a buggy. ", "Edna was a little miss, just merging into her teens; ", "and the realization that she herself was nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her. ", "But he, too, went the way of dreams. ", "She was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed to be the climax of her fate. ", "It was when the face and figure of a great tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. ", "The persistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. ", "The hopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion. ", "The picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. ", "Any one may possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or comment. ", "( This was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) ", "In the presence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as she handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the likeness. ", "When alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold glass passionately. ", "Her marriage to Leonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this respect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of Fate. ", "It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him. ", "He fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his suit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired. ", "He pleased her; ", "his absolute devotion flattered her. ", "She fancied there was a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she was mistaken. ", "Add to this the violent opposition of her father and her sister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no further for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for her husband. ", "The acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian, was not for her in this world. ", "As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams. ", "But it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry officer and the engaged young man and a few others; ", "and Edna found herself face to face with the realities. ", "She grew fond of her husband, realizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby threatening its dissolution. ", "She was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. ", "She would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart; ", "she would sometimes forget them. ", "The year before they had spent part of the summer with their grandmother Pontellier in Iberville. ", "Feeling secure regarding their happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an occasional intense longing. ", "Their absence was a sort of relief, though she did not admit this, even to herself. ", "It seemed to free her of a responsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not fitted her. ", "Edna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea. ", "But a good part of it escaped her. ", "She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle's shoulder. ", "She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. ", "It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath of freedom. ", "There was the sound of approaching voices. ", "It was Robert, surrounded by a troop of children, searching for them. ", "The two little Pontelliers were with him, and he carried Madame Ratignolle's little girl in his arms. ", "There were other children beside, and two nurse-maids followed, looking disagreeable and resigned. ", "The women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax their muscles. ", "Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the bath-house. ", "The children all scampered off to the awning, and they stood there in a line, gazing upon the intruding lovers, still exchanging their vows and sighs. ", "The lovers got up, with only a silent protest, and walked slowly away somewhere else. ", "The children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went over to join them. ", "Madame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; ", "she complained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. ", "She leaned draggingly upon his arm as they walked. ", "VIII   \"Do me a favor, Robert,\" spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost as soon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way. ", "She looked up in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the umbrella which he had lifted. \" ", "Granted; ", "as many as you like,\" he returned, glancing down into her eyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation. ", "\"I only ask for one; ", "let Mrs. Pontellier alone.\" ", "\"Tiens!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh. \" ", "Voila que Madame Ratignolle est jalouse!\" ", "\"Nonsense! ", "I'm in earnest; ", "I mean what I say. ", "Let Mrs. Pontellier alone.\" ", "\"Why?\" he asked; ", "himself growing serious at his companion's solicitation. ", "\"She is not one of us; ", "she is not like us. ", "She might make the unfortunate blunder of taking you seriously. ", "His face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began to beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked. ", "\" Why shouldn't she take me seriously?\" ", "he demanded sharply. \" ", "Am I a comedian, a clown, a jack-in-the-box? ", "Why shouldn't she? ", "You Creoles! ", "I have no patience with you! ", "Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme? ", "I hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously. ", "I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur. ", "If I thought there was any doubt-\"  \"Oh, enough, Robert!\" she broke into his heated outburst. ", "\" You are not thinking of what you are saying. ", "You speak with about as little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the sand. ", "If your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with any intention of being convincing, you would not be the gentleman we all know you to be, and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you.\" ", "Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel. ", "The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently. \" ", "Oh! well! ", "That isn't it,\" slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head. ", "\" You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a fellow.\" ", "\"Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments? ", "Ma foi!\" ", "\"It isn't pleasant to have a woman tell you-\" he went on, unheedingly, but breaking off suddenly: ", "Now if I were like Arobin-you remember Alcee Arobin and that story of the consul's wife at Biloxi?\" ", "And he related the story of Alcee Arobin and the consul's wife; ", "and another about the tenor of the French Opera, who received letters which should never have been written; ", "and still other stories, grave and gay, till Mrs. Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously was apparently forgotten. ", "Madame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take the hour's rest which she considered helpful. ", "Before leaving her, Robert begged her pardon for the impatience-he called it rudeness-with which he had received her well-meant caution. ", "\"You made one mistake, Adele,\" he said, with a light smile; ", "\"there is no earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously. ", "You should have warned me against taking myself seriously. ", "Your advice might then have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection. ", "Au revoir. ", "But you look tired,\" he added, solicitously. \" ", "Would you like a cup of bouillon? ", "Shall I stir you a toddy? ", "Let me mix you a toddy with a drop of Angostura. ", "\" She acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and acceptable. ", "He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart from the cottages and lying to the rear of the house. ", "And he himself brought her the golden-brown bouillon, in a dainty Sevres cup, with a flaky cracker or two on the saucer. ", "She thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open door, and received the cup from his hands. ", "She told him he was a bon garcon, and she meant it. ", "Robert thanked her and turned away toward \"the house. ", "The lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. ", "They were leaning toward each other as the water-oaks bent from the sea. ", "There was not a particle of earth beneath their feet. ", "Their heads might have been turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether. ", "The lady in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more jaded than usual. ", "There was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the children. ", "Robert scanned the distance for any such apparition. ", "They would doubtless remain away till the dinner hour. ", "The young man ascended to his mother's room. ", "It was situated at the top of the house, made up of odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. ", "Two broad dormer windows looked out toward the Gulf, and as far across it as a man's eye might reach. ", "The furnishings of the room were light, cool, and practical. ", "Madame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. ", "A little black girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine. ", "The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided of imperiling her health. ", "Robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer windows. ", "He took a book from his pocket and began energetically to read it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned the leaves. ", "The sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room; ", "it was of a ponderous, by-gone make. ", "In the lulls, Robert and his mother exchanged bits of desultory conversation. ", "\"Where is Mrs. Pontellier?\" ", "\"Down at the beach with the children.\" ", "\"I promised to lend her the Goncourt. ", "Don't forget to take it down when you go; ", "it's there on the bookshelf over the small table.\" ", "Clatter, clatter, clatter, bang! ", "for the next five or eight minutes. ", "\"Where is Victor going with the rockaway?\" ", "\"The rockaway? ", "Victor?\" ", "\"Yes; ", "down there in front. ", "He seems to be getting ready to drive away somewhere.\" ", "\"Call him.\" ", "Clatter, clatter! ", "Robert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back at the wharf. ", "\"He won't look up.\" ", "Madame Lebrun flew to the window. ", "She called \"Victor!\" ", "She waved a handkerchief and called again. ", "The young fellow below got into the vehicle and started the horse off at a gallop. ", "Madame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. ", "Victor was the younger son and brother-a tete montee, with a temper which invited violence and a will which no ax could break. ", "\"Whenever you say the word I'm ready to thrash any amount of reason into him that he's able to hold.\" ", "\"If your father had only lived!\" ", "Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter, bang! ", "It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the universe and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of a more intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been removed to other spheres during the early years of their married life. ", "\"What do you hear from Montel? ", "Montel was a middle-aged gentleman whose vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill the void which Monsieur Lebrun's taking off had left in the Lebrun household. ", "Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter! ", "\"I have a letter somewhere,\" looking in the machine drawer and finding the letter in the bottom of the workbasket. \" ", "He says to tell you he will be in Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,\"-clatter, clatter!-\"and if you still have the intention of joining him\"-bang! ", "clatter, clatter, bang! ", "\"Why didn't you tell me so before, mother? ", "You know I wanted-\" Clatter, clatter, clatter! \" ", "Do you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? ", "She will be in late to luncheon again. ", "She never starts to get ready for luncheon till the last minute.\" ", "Clatter, clatter! ", "\" Where are you going?\" ", "\"Where did you say the Goncourt was?\" ", "IX    ", "Every light in the hall was ablaze; ", "every lamp turned as high as it could be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. ", "The lamps were fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room. ", "Some one had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful festoons between. ", "The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf. ", "It was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held between Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach. ", "An unusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay over Sunday; ", "and they were being suitably entertained by their families, with the material help of Madame Lebrun. ", "The dining tables had all been removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and in clusters. ", "Each little family group had had its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening. ", "There was now an apparent disposition to relax; ", "to widen the circle of confidences and give a more general tone to the conversation. ", "Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime. ", "A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had brought down. ", "The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so, and making their authority felt. ", "Music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished, or rather, offered. ", "But there was nothing systematic about the programme, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation. ", "At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to play the piano. ", "They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin's colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism. ", "They played a duet from \"Zampa,\" and at the earnest solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to \"The Poet and the Peasant.\" ", "\"Allez vous-en! Sapristi!\" shrieked the parrot outside the door. ", "He was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that summer. ", "Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned to regions of darkness. ", "Victor Lebrun objected; ", "and his decrees were as immutable as those of Fate. ", "The parrot fortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst. ", "Later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city. ", "A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor. ", "The mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension. ", "She need have had no apprehension. ", "The child was mistress of the situation. ", "She had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights. ", "Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially crimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head. ", "Her poses were full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering. ", "But there was no reason why every one should not dance. ", "Madame Ratignolle could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others. ", "She played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring. ", "She was keeping up her music on account of the children, she said; ", "because she and her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive. ", "Almost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to separate during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling around the room in the arms of a man. ", "They might have danced together, but they did not think of it. ", "The children were sent to bed. ", "Some went submissively; ", "others with shrieks and protests as they were dragged away. ", "They had been permitted to sit up till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence. ", "The ice-cream was passed around with cake-gold and silver cake arranged on platters in alternate slices; ", "it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision of Victor. ", "It was pronounced a great success-excellent if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been frozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it. ", "Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about recommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess. ", "After Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with Robert, and once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and swayed like a reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the gallery and seated herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded a view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the Gulf. ", "There was a soft effulgence in the east.

", "One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled \"Solitude. ", "It was a short, plaintive, minor strain. ", "The name of the piece was something else, but she called it \"Solitude. ", "\" When she heard it there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the seashore. ", "He was naked.

", "Another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire gown, taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue between tall hedges. ", "Again, another reminded her of children at play, and still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat. ", "The very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano sent a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier's spinal column. ", "It was not the first time she had heard an artist at the piano. ", "Perhaps it was the first time she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an impress of the abiding truth. ", "She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and blaze before her imagination. ", "She waited in vain. ", "She saw no pictures of solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. ", "But the very passions themselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the waves daily beat upon her splendid body.

", "Of late he had sometimes held away from her for an entire day, redoubling his devotion upon the next and the next, as though to make up for hours that had been lost.

", "The white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the mystery and the softness of sleep. ", "Most of them walked into the water as though into a native element. ", "The sea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into one another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy crests that coiled back like slow, white serpents. ", "Edna had attempted all summer to learn to swim. ", "She had received instructions from both the men and women; ", "in some instances from the children. ", "Robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; ", "and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts. ", "A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water, unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her. ", "But that night she was like the little tottering, stumbling, clutching child, who of a sudden realizes its powers, and walks for the first time alone, boldly and with over-confidence. ", "She could have shouted for joy. ", "She did shout for joy, as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted her body to the surface of the water. ", "A feeling of exultation overtook her, as if some power of significant import had been given her to control the working of her body and her soul. ", "She grew daring and reckless, overestimating her strength. ", "She wanted to swim far out, where no woman had swum before. ", "Her unlooked-for achievement was the subject of wonder, applause, and admiration. ", "Each one congratulated himself that his special teachings had accomplished this desired end. ", "\"How easy it is!\" ", "she thought. ", "\" It is nothing,\" she said aloud; ", "why did I not discover before that it was nothing. ", "Think of the time I have lost splashing about like a baby!\" ", "She would not join the groups in their sports and bouts, but intoxicated with her newly conquered power, she swam out alone. ", "She turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and solitude, which the vast expanse of water, meeting and melting with the moonlit sky, conveyed to her excited fancy. ", "As she swam she seemed to be reaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself. ", "Once she turned and looked toward the shore, toward the people she had left there. ", "She had not gone any great distance-that is, what would have been a great distance for an experienced swimmer. ", "But to her unaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect of a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to overcome. ", "A quick vision of death smote her soul, and for a second of time appalled and enfeebled her senses. ", "But by an effort she rallied her staggering faculties and managed to regain the land. ", "She made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of terror, except to say to her husband, \"I thought I should have perished out there alone.\" ", "\"You were not so very far, my dear; ", "I was watching you,\" he told her. ", "Edna went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes and was ready to return home before the others had left the water. ", "She started to walk away alone. ", "They all called to her and shouted to her. ", "She waved a dissenting hand, and went on, paying no further heed to their renewed cries which sought to detain her. \" ", "Sometimes I am tempted to think that Mrs. Pontellier is capricious,\"  said Madame Lebrun, who was amusing herself immensely and feared that Edna's abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure. ", "\"I know she is,\" assented Mr. Pontellier; ", "\"sometimes, not often.

", "On the twenty-eighth of August, at the hour of midnight, and if the moon is shining-the moon must be shining-a spirit that has haunted these shores for ages rises up from the Gulf.

", "His search has always hitherto been fruitless, and he has sunk back, disheartened, into the sea. ", "But to-night he found Mrs. Pontellier. ", "Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell.

", "He did not mind the entreaty, but the tone with its delicate note of pathos was like a reproach. ", "He could not explain; ", "he could not tell her that he had penetrated her mood and understood. ", "He said nothing except to offer her his arm, for, by her own admission, she was exhausted. ", "She had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp, letting her white skirts trail along the dewy path. ", "She took his arm, but she did not lean upon it. ", "She let her hand lie listlessly, as though her thoughts were elsewhere-somewhere in advance of her body, and she was striving to overtake them.

", "\"I'll stay out here. ", "Good-night.\" ", "\"Shall I get you a pillow?\" ", "\"There's one here,\" she said, feeling about, for they were in the shadow. ", "\"It must be soiled; ", "the children have been tumbling it about.\" ", "\"No matter.\" ", "And having discovered the pillow, she adjusted it beneath her head. ", "She extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of relief. ", "She was not a supercilious or an over-dainty woman. ", "She was not much given to reclining in the hammock, and when she did so it was with no cat-like suggestion of voluptuous ease, but with a beneficent repose which seemed to invade her whole body. \" ", "Shall I stay with you till Mr. Pontellier comes?\" asked Robert, seating himself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold of the hammock rope which was fastened to the post.

", "\" Do you know what time it is? ", "How long are you going to stay out here?\" ", "\"I don't know. ", "Will you get the shawl?\" ", "\"Of course I will,\" he said, rising. ", "He went over to the house, walking along the grass. ", "She watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight. ", "It was past midnight. ", "It was very quiet. ", "When he returned with the shawl she took it and kept it in her hand. ", "She did not put it around her. \" ", "Did you say I should stay till Mr. Pontellier came back?\" ", "\"I said you might if you wished to.\" ", "He seated himself again and rolled a cigarette, which he smoked in silence. ", "Neither did Mrs. Pontellier speak. ", "No multitude of words could have been more significant than those moments of silence, or more pregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire.

", "Another time she would have gone in at his request. ", "She would, through habit, have yielded to his desire; ", "not with any sense of submission or obedience to his compelling wishes, but unthinkingly, as we walk, move, sit, stand, go through the daily treadmill of the life which has been portioned out to us. ", "Edna, dear, are you not coming in soon?\" ", "he asked again, this time fondly, with a note of entreaty. ", "No; ", "I am going to stay out here.\" ", "\"This is more than folly,\" he blurted out. ", "\" I can't permit you to stay out there all night.

", "She did not wish any. ", "He drew up the rocker, hoisted his slippered feet on the rail, and proceeded to smoke a cigar.

", "Mr. Pontellier once more seated himself with elevated feet, and after a reasonable interval of time smoked some more cigars. ", "Edna began to feel like one who awakens gradually out of a dream, a delicious, grotesque, impossible dream, to feel again the realities pressing into her soul.

", "They were troubled and feverish hours, disturbed with dreams that were intangible, that eluded her, leaving only an impression upon her half-awakened senses of something unattainable. ", "She was up and dressed in the cool of the early morning. ", "The air was invigorating and steadied somewhat her faculties. ", "However, she was not seeking refreshment or help from any source, either external or from within. ", "She was blindly following whatever impulse moved her, as if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction, and freed her soul of responsibility. ", "Most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep. ", "A few, who intended to go over to the Cheniere for mass, were moving about.

", "She did not appear conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding his presence. ", "He was apparently equally unconscious of anything extraordinary in the situation. ", "But his face was suffused with a quiet glow when he met her. ", "They went together back to the kitchen to drink coffee. ", "There was no time to wait for any nicety of service. ", "They stood outside the window and the cook passed them their coffee and a roll, which they drank and ate from the window-sill. ", "Edna said it tasted good. ", "She had not thought of coffee nor of anything.

", "At a distance they could see the curious procession moving toward the wharf-the lovers, shoulder to shoulder, creeping; ", "the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; ", "old Monsieur Farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted Spanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm, bringing up the rear. ", "Robert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. ", "No one present understood what they said. ", "Her name was Mariequita. ", "She had a round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. ", "Her hands were small, and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. ", "Her feet were broad and coarse. ", "She did not strive to hide them. ", "Edna looked at her feet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes. ", "Beaudelet grumbled because Mariequita was there, taking up so much room. ", "In reality he was annoyed at having old Monsieur Farival, who considered himself the better sailor of the two. ", "But he would not quarrel with so old a man as Monsieur Farival, so he quarreled with Mariequita. ", "The girl was deprecatory at one moment, appealing to Robert.

", "She ran her fingers through her loosened hair for a while. ", "She looked at her round arms as she held them straight up and rubbed them one after the other, observing closely, as if it were something she saw for the first time, the fine, firm quality and texture of her flesh.

", "No one had yet gone to bed but the children. ", "Leonce had been very uneasy at first, Madame Ratignolle said, and had wanted to start at once for the Cheniere. ", "But Monsieur Farival had assured him that his wife was only overcome with sleep and fatigue, that Tonie would bring her safely back later in the day; ", "and he had thus been dissuaded from crossing the bay.

", "She had no desire to sleep or to retire; ", "nor did she feel like going over to sit with the Ratignolles, or to join Madame Lebrun and a group whose animated voices reached her as they sat in conversation before the house. ", "She let her mind wander back over her stay at Grand Isle; ", "and she tried to discover wherein this summer had been different from any and every other summer of her life. ", "She could only realize that she herself-her present self-was in some way different from the other self.

", "She was not tired, and she felt that he was not. ", "She regretted that he had gone. ", "It was so much more natural to have him stay when he was not absolutely required to leave her.

", "She had not seen him during the afternoon; ", "she had heard some one say he was at the house, upstairs with his mother. ", "This she had thought nothing of, though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the afternoon, when she went down to the beach. ", "She looked across at him, where he sat beside Madame Lebrun, who presided. ", "Edna's face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she never thought of disguising. ", "He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance. ", "He looked embarrassed and uneasy. ", "When is he going? ", "\" she asked of everybody in general, as if Robert were not there to answer for himself. \" ", "To-night!\" ", "\" This very evening!\" ", "\" Did you ever!\" ", "\" What possesses him!\" were some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in French and English. ", "\"Impossible!\" ", "she exclaimed. ", "\" How can a person start off from Grand Isle to Mexico at a moment's notice, as if he were going over to Klein's or to the wharf or down to the beach?\" ", "\"I said all along I was going to Mexico; ", "I've been saying so for years!\" cried Robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of a man defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects. ", "Madame Lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle. ", "\"Please let Robert explain why he is going, and why he is going to-night,\" she called out. \" ", "Really, this table is getting to be more and more like Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once. ", "Sometimes-I hope God will forgive me-but positively, sometimes I wish Victor would lose the power of speech. ", "Victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish, of which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it might afford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself. ", "Monsieur Farival thought that Victor should have been taken out in mid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. ", "Victor thought there would be more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim for making themselves universally obnoxious. ", "Madame Lebrun grew a trifle hysterical; ", "Robert called his brother some sharp, hard names. ", "\"There's nothing much to explain, mother,\" he said; ", "though he explained, nevertheless-looking chiefly at Edna-that he could only meet the gentleman whom he intended to join at Vera Cruz by taking such and such a steamer, which left New Orleans on such a day; ", "that Beaudelet was going out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave him an opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time. ", "\"But when did you make up your mind to all this?\" demanded Monsieur Farival. ", "\"This afternoon,\" returned Robert, with a shade of annoyance. ", "\"At what time this afternoon?\" persisted the old gentleman, with nagging determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of justice. ", "\"At four o'clock this afternoon, Monsieur Farival,\" Robert replied, in a high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded Edna of some gentleman on the stage. ", "She had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork. ", "The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to no one but themselves. ", "The lady in black had once received a pair of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico, with very special indulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border. ", "Father Fochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; ", "but he had not done so to her satisfaction. ", "And she begged that Robert would interest himself, and discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads. ", "Madame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution in dealing with the Mexicans, who, she considered, were a treacherous people, unscrupulous and revengeful. ", "She trusted she did them no injustice in thus condemning them as a race. ", "She had known personally but one Mexican, who made and sold excellent tamales, and whom she would have trusted implicitly, so soft-spoken was he. ", "One day he was arrested for stabbing his wife. ", "She never knew whether he had been hanged or not. ", "Victor had grown hilarious, and was attempting to tell an anecdote about a Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in Dauphine Street. ", "No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival, who went into convulsions over the droll story. ", "Edna wondered if they had all gone mad, to be talking and clamoring at that rate. ", "She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or the Mexicans. \" ", "At what time do you leave? ", "\" she asked Robert. \" ", "At ten,\" he told her. \" ", "Beaudelet wants to wait for the moon.\" ", "\"Are you all ready to go?\" ", "\"Quite ready. ", "I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the city.\" ", "He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna, having finished her black coffee, left the table. ", "She went directly to her room. ", "The little cottage was close and stuffy after leaving the outer air. ", "But she did not mind; ", "there appeared to be a hundred different things demanding her attention indoors. ", "She began to set the toilet-stand to rights, grumbling at the negligence of the quadroon, who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed. ", "She gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of chairs, and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer. ", "She changed her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper. ", "She rearranged her hair, combing and brushing it with unusual energy. ", "Then she went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed. ", "They were very playful and inclined to talk-to do anything but lie quiet and go to sleep. ", "Edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and told her she need not return. ", "Then she sat and told the children a story. ", "Instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their wakefulness. ", "She left them in heated argument, speculating about the conclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the following night. ", "The little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to have Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr. Robert went away. ", "Edna returned answer that she had already undressed, that she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the house later. ", "She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to remove her peignoir. ", "But changing her mind once more she resumed the peignoir, and went outside and sat down before her door. ", "She was overheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while. ", "Madame Ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter. \" ", "All that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,\" replied Edna, \"and moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. ", "The idea of Robert starting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way! ", "As if it were a matter of life and death! ", "Never saying a word about it all morning when he was with me.\" ", "\"Yes,\" agreed Madame Ratignolle. ", "\" I think it was showing us all-you especially-very little consideration. ", "It wouldn't have surprised me in any of the others; ", "those Lebruns are all given to heroics. ", "But I must say I should never have expected such a thing from Robert. ", "Are you not coming down? ", "Come on, dear; ", "it doesn't look friendly.\" ", "\"No,\" said Edna, a little sullenly. ", "\" I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; ", "I don't feel like it.\" ", "\"You needn't dress; ", "you look all right; ", "fasten a belt around your waist. ", "Just look at me!\" ", "\"No,\" persisted Edna; ", "but you go on. ", "Madame Lebrun might be offended if we both stayed away.\" ", "Madame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation which was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans. ", "Somewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag. \" ", "Aren't you feeling well?\" he asked. ", "Oh, well enough. ", "Are you going right away?\" ", "He lit a match and looked at his watch. ", "In twenty minutes,\" he said. ", "The sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while. ", "He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch. ", "\"Get a chair,\" said Edna. ", "\"This will do,\" he replied. ", "He put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the heat. ", "\"Take the fan,\" said Edna, offering it to him. ", "\"Oh, no! ", "Thank you. ", "It does no good; ", "you have to stop fanning some time, and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.\" ", "\"That's one of the ridiculous things which men always say. ", "I have never known one to speak otherwise of fanning. ", "How long will you be gone?\" ", "\"Forever, perhaps. ", "I don't know. ", "It depends upon a good many things.\" ", "\"Well, in case it shouldn't be forever, how long will it be?\" ", "\"I don't know.\" ", "\"This seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for. ", "I don't like it. ", "I don't understand your motive for silence and mystery, never saying a word to me about it this morning. ", "\" He remained silent, not offering to defend himself.

", "\" But can't you understand? ", "I've grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all the time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. ", "You don't even offer an excuse for it. ", "Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of how pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter.\" ", "\"So was I,\" he blurted. ", "\" Perhaps that's the-\" ", "He stood up suddenly and held out his hand. ", "Good-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; ", "good-by. ", "You won't-I hope you won't completely forget me.\" ", "She clung to his hand, striving to detain him. \" ", "Write to me when you get there, won't you, Robert?\" ", "she entreated. ", "\"I will, thank you. ", "Good-by. ", "\" How unlike Robert! ", "The merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than \"I will, thank you; ", "good-by,\" to such a request. ", "He had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house, for he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out there with an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. ", "They walked away in the darkness. ", "She could only hear Beaudelet's voice; ", "Robert had apparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion. ", "Edna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to hide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the emotion which was troubling-tearing-her. ", "Her eyes were brimming with tears. ", "For the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she had felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and later as a young woman. ", "The recognition did not lessen the reality, the poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability. ", "The past was nothing to her; ", "offered no lesson which she was willing to heed. ", "The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate. ", "The present alone was significant; ", "was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being demanded. ", "XVI   \"Do you miss your friend greatly?\" asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning as she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on her way to the beach. ", "She spent much of her time in the water since she had acquired finally the art of swimming. ", "As their stay at Grand Isle drew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she knew. ", "When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in Edna's mind; ", "or, better, the feeling which constantly possessed her. ", "Robert's going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning out of everything. ", "The conditions of her life were in no way changed, but her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing. ", "She sought him everywhere-in others whom she induced to talk about him. ", "She went up in the mornings to Madame Lebrun's room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine. ", "She sat there and chatted at intervals as Robert had done. ", "She gazed around the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and discovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined with the keenest interest, appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its pages. ", "There was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in her lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. ", "The eyes alone in the baby suggested the man. ", "And that was he also in kilts, at the age of five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. ", "It made Edna laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers; ", "while another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions. ", "But there was no recent picture, none which suggested the Robert who had gone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him. ", "\"Oh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for them himself! ", "He found wiser use for his money, he says,\" explained Madame Lebrun. ", "She had a letter from him, written before he left New Orleans. ", "Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to look for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the mantelpiece. ", "The letter was on the bookshelf. ", "It possessed the greatest interest and attraction for Edna; ", "the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark, the handwriting. ", "She examined every detail of the outside before opening it. ", "There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the city that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that he was well, and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately remembered to all. ", "There was no special message to Edna except a postscript saying that if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish the book which he had been reading to her, his mother would find it in his room, among other books there on the table. ", "Edna experienced a pang of jealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her. ", "Every one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. ", "Even her husband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert's departure, expressed regret that he had gone. ", "\"How do you get on without him, Edna?\" he asked. ", "\"It's very dull without him,\" she admitted. ", "Mr. Pontellier had seen Robert in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more. ", "Where had they met? ", "On Carondelet Street, in the morning. ", "They had gone \"in\" and had a drink and a cigar together. ", "What had they talked about? ", "Chiefly about his prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought were promising. ", "How did he look? ", "How did he seem-grave, or gay, or how? ", "Quite cheerful, and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which Mr. Pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek fortune and adventure in a strange, queer country. ", "Edna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children persisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. ", "She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive. ", "It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him. ", "The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way resembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever expected to feel. ", "She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves. ", "They had never taken the form of struggles. ", "They belonged to her and were her own, and she entertained the conviction that she had a right to them and that they concerned no one but herself. ", "Edna had once told Madame Ratignolle that she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one. ", "Then had followed a rather heated argument; ", "the two women did not appear to understand each other or to be talking the same language. ", "Edna tried to appease her friend, to explain. ", "\"I would give up the unessential; ", "I would give my money, I would give my life for my children; ", "but I wouldn't give myself.

", "I'm sure I couldn't do more than that.\" ", "\"Oh, yes you could!\" laughed Edna. ", "She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz's question the morning that lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend. ", "Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; ", "is it you? ", "Why, of course I miss Robert. ", "Are you going down to bathe?\" ", "\"Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven't been in the surf all summer,\" replied the woman, disagreeably. ", "\"I beg your pardon,\" offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz's avoidance of the water had furnished a theme for much pleasantry. ", "Some among them thought it was on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet, while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament. ", "Mademoiselle offered Edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket, by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. ", "She habitually ate chocolates for their sustaining quality; ", "they contained much nutriment in small compass, she said. ", "They saved her from starvation, as Madame Lebrun's table was utterly impossible; ", "and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it. ", "\"She must feel very lonely without her son,\" said Edna, desiring to change the subject. ", "Her favorite son, too. ", "It must have been quite hard to let him go.\" ", "Mademoiselle laughed maliciously. \" ", "Her favorite son! ", "Oh, dear! ", "Who could have been imposing such a tale upon you? ", "Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone. ", "She has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is. ", "She worships him and the ground he walks on. ", "Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself. ", "Favorite son, indeed! ", "I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear. ", "I liked to see him and to hear him about the place-the only Lebrun who is worth a pinch of salt. ", "He comes to see me often in the city. ", "I like to play to him. ", "That Victor! hanging would be too good for him. ", "It's a wonder Robert hasn't beaten him to death long ago.\" ", "\"I thought he had great patience with his brother,\" offered Edna, glad to be talking about Robert, no matter what was said. ", "\"Oh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,\" said Mademoiselle. ", "\"It was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some sort of claim upon. ", "He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or walking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket-I don't remember what;-and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good while. ", "It's about time he was getting another.\" ", "\"Was her name Mariequita?\" asked Edna. \" ", "Mariequita-yes, that was it; ", "Mariequita. ", "I had forgotten. ", "Oh, she's a sly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!\" ", "Edna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have listened to her venom so long. ", "For some reason she felt depressed, almost unhappy. ", "She had not intended to go into the water; ", "but she donned her bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the shade of the children's tent. ", "The water was growing cooler as the season advanced. ", "Edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and invigorated her. ", "She remained a long time in the water, half hoping that Mademoiselle Reisz would not wait for her. ", "But Mademoiselle waited. ", "She was very amiable during the walk back, and raved much over Edna's appearance in her bathing suit. ", "She talked about music. ", "She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in her pocket. ", "\"When do you leave?\" asked Edna. \" ", "Next Monday; ", "and you?\" ", "\"The following week,\" answered Edna, adding, \"It has been a pleasant summer, hasn't it, Mademoiselle?\" ", "\"Well,\" agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, \"rather pleasant, if it hadn't been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins.

", "\"I'm going to get my dinner at the club. ", "Good night. ", "He went into the hall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house. ", "She was somewhat familiar with such scenes. ", "They had often made her very unhappy. ", "On a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner. ", "Sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook.

", "It was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim light which the maid had turned low. ", "She went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. ", "All the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage. ", "She was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet, half-darkness which met her moods. ", "But the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars. ", "They jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise, devoid even of hope. ", "She turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping, without resting. ", "She carried in her hands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a ball, and flung from her. ", "Once she stopped, and taking off her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet. ", "When she saw it lying there, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to crush it. ", "But her small boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark upon the little glittering circlet. ", "In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth. ", "She wanted to destroy something.

", "A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to discover what was the matter. \" ", "A vase fell upon the hearth,\" said Edna. ", "\" Never mind; ", "leave it till morning.\" ", "\"Oh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma'am,\" insisted the young woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet. \" ", "And here's your ring, ma'am, under the chair. ", "Edna held out her hand, and taking the ring, slipped it upon her finger. ", "XVIII    ", "The following morning Mr. Pontellier, upon leaving for his office, asked Edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library. ", "\"I hardly think we need new fixtures, Leonce. ", "Don't let us get anything new; ", "you are too extravagant.

", "He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures. ", "He kissed her good-by, and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself. ", "She was unusually pale and very quiet. ", "She stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house, and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by. ", "She inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown. ", "The boys were dragging along the banquette a small \"express wagon,\" which they had filled with blocks and sticks. ", "The quadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. ", "A fruit vender was crying his wares in the street. ", "Edna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon her face. ", "She felt no interest in anything about her. ", "The street, the children, the fruit vender, the flowers growing there under her eyes, were all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become antagonistic. ", "She went back into the house. ", "She had thought of speaking to the cook concerning her blunders of the previous night; ", "but Mr. Pontellier had saved her that disagreeable mission, for which she was so poorly fitted. ", "Mr. Pontellier's arguments were usually convincing with those whom he employed. ", "He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna would sit down that evening, and possibly a few subsequent evenings, to a dinner deserving of the name. ", "Edna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches. ", "She could see their shortcomings and defects, which were glaring in her eyes. ", "She tried to work a little, but found she was not in the humor. ", "Finally she gathered together a few of the sketches-those which she considered the least discreditable; ", "and she carried them with her when, a little later, she dressed and left the house. ", "She looked handsome and distinguished in her street gown. ", "The tan of the seashore had left her face, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her heavy, yellow-brown hair. ", "There were a few freckles on her face, and a small, dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple, half-hidden in her hair. ", "As Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert. ", "She was still under the spell of her infatuation. ", "She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering. ", "But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. ", "It was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; ", "it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing. ", "Edna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle's. ", "Their intimacy, begun at Grand Isle, had not declined, and they had seen each other with some frequency since their return to the city. ", "The Ratignolles lived at no great distance from Edna's home, on the corner of a side street, where Monsieur Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a steady and prosperous trade. ", "His father had been in the business before him, and Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an enviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness. ", "His family lived in commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side within the porte cochere. ", "There was something which Edna thought very French, very foreign, about their whole manner of living. ", "In the large and pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house, the Ratignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree musicale, sometimes diversified by card-playing. ", "There was a friend who played upon the 'cello. ", "One brought his flute and another his violin, while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano with various degrees of taste and agility. ", "The Ratignolles' soirees musicales were widely known, and it was considered a privilege to be invited to them. ", "Edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had returned that morning from the laundry. ", "She at once abandoned her occupation upon seeing Edna, who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence. \"'Cite can do it as well as I; ", "it is really her business,\" she explained to Edna, who apologized for interrupting her. ", "And she summoned a young black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her. ", "She told her to notice particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur Ratignolle's, which was missing last week, had been returned; ", "and to be sure to set to one side such pieces as required mending and darning. ", "Then placing an arm around Edna's waist, she led her to the front of the house, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars. ", "Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich, melting curves of her white throat. ", "\"Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,\" said Edna with a smile when they were seated. ", "She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them. ", "\" I believe I ought to work again. ", "I feel as if I wanted to be doing something. ", "What do you think of them? ", "Do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more? ", "I might study for a while with Laidpore.\" ", "She knew that Madame Ratignolle's opinion in such a matter would be next to valueless, that she herself had not alone decided, but determined; ", "but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to put heart into her venture. ", "\"Your talent is immense, dear!\" ", "\"Nonsense!\" protested Edna, well pleased. ", "\"Immense, I tell you,\" persisted Madame Ratignolle, surveying the sketches one by one, at close range, then holding them at arm's length, narrowing her eyes, and dropping her head on one side. \" ", "Surely, this Bavarian peasant is worthy of framing; ", "and this basket of apples! ", "never have I seen anything more lifelike. ", "One might almost be tempted to reach out a hand and take one.\" ", "Edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her friend's praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth. ", "She retained a few of the sketches, and gave all the rest to Madame Ratignolle, who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly exhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a little later for his midday dinner. ", "Mr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the earth. ", "His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his goodness of heart, his broad charity, and common sense. ", "He and his wife spoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its un-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation. ", "Edna's husband spoke English with no accent whatever. ", "The Ratignolles understood each other perfectly. ", "If ever the fusion of two human beings into one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their union. ", "As Edna seated herself at table with them she thought, \"Better a dinner of herbs,\" though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every way satisfying. ", "Monsieur Ratignolle was delighted to see her, though he found her looking not so well as at Grand Isle, and he advised a tonic. ", "He talked a good deal on various topics, a little politics, some city news and neighborhood gossip. ", "He spoke with an animation and earnestness that gave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. ", "His wife was keenly interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the better to listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth. ", "Edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them. ", "The little glimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her, gave her no regret, no longing. ", "It was not a condition of life which fitted her, and she could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui. ", "She was moved by a kind of commiseration for Madame Ratignolle,-a pity for that colorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region of blind contentment, in which no moment of anguish ever visited her soul, in which she would never have the taste of life's delirium. ", "Edna vaguely wondered what she meant by \"life's delirium. ", "\" It had crossed her thought like some unsought, extraneous impression. ", "XIX    ", "Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles. ", "She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients. ", "She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. ", "She completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called upon her. ", "She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne menagere, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending herself to any passing caprice. ", "Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain tacit submissiveness in his wife. ", "But her new and unexpected line of conduct completely bewildered him. ", "It shocked him. ", "Then her absolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him. ", "When Mr. Pontellier became rude, Edna grew insolent. ", "She had resolved never to take another step backward. ", "\"It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family.\" ", "\"I feel like painting,\" answered Edna. ", "\" Perhaps I shan't always feel like it.\" ", "\"Then in God's name paint! ", "but don't let the family go to the devil. ", "There's Madame Ratignolle; ", "because she keeps up her music, she doesn't let everything else go to chaos. ", "And she's more of a musician than you are a painter.\" ", "\"She isn't a musician, and I'm not a painter. ", "It isn't on account of painting that I let things go.\" ", "\"On account of what, then?\" ", "\"Oh! ", "I don't know. ", "Let me alone; ", "you bother me. ", "\" It sometimes entered Mr. Pontellier's mind to wonder if his wife were not growing a little unbalanced mentally. ", "He could see plainly that she was not herself. ", "That is, he could not see that she was becoming herself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment with which to appear before the world. ", "Her husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his office. ", "Edna went up to her atelier-a bright room in the top of the house. ", "She was working with great energy and interest, without accomplishing anything, however, which satisfied her even in the smallest degree. ", "For a time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art. ", "The boys posed for her. ", "They thought it amusing at first, but the occupation soon lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game arranged especially for their entertainment. ", "The quadroon sat for hours before Edna's palette, patient as a savage, while the house-maid took charge of the children, and the drawing-room went undusted. ", "But the house-maid, too, served her term as model when Edna perceived that the young woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that her hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration. ", "While Edna worked she sometimes sang low the little air, \"Ah! si tu savais! ", "\" It moved her with recollections. ", "She could hear again the ripple of the water, the flapping sail. ", "She could see the glint of the moon upon the bay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind. ", "A subtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold upon the brushes and making her eyes burn. ", "There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. ", "She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day. ", "She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places. ", "She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in. ", "And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested. ", "There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,-when it did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; ", "when life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. ", "She could not work on such a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood. ", "XX    ", "It was during such a mood that Edna hunted up Mademoiselle Reisz. ", "She had not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her by their last interview; ", "but she nevertheless felt a desire to see her-above all, to listen while she played upon the piano. ", "Quite early in the afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist. ", "Unfortunately she had mislaid or lost Mademoiselle Reisz's card, and looking up her address in the city directory, she found that the woman lived on Bienville Street, some distance away. ", "The directory which fell into her hands was a year or more old, however, and upon reaching the number indicated, Edna discovered that the house was occupied by a respectable family of mulattoes who had chambres garnies to let. ", "They had been living there for six months, and knew absolutely nothing of a Mademoiselle Reisz. ", "In fact, they knew nothing of any of their neighbors; ", "their lodgers were all people of the highest distinction, they assured Edna. ", "She did not linger to discuss class distinctions with Madame Pouponne, but hastened to a neighboring grocery store, feeling sure that Mademoiselle would have left her address with the proprietor. ", "He knew Mademoiselle Reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know her, he informed his questioner. ", "In truth, he did not want to know her at all, or anything concerning her-the most disagreeable and unpopular woman who ever lived in Bienville Street. ", "He thanked heaven she had left the neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know where she had gone. ", "Edna's desire to see Mademoiselle Reisz had increased tenfold since these unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. ", "She was wondering who could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly occurred to her that Madame Lebrun would be the one most likely to do so. ", "She knew it was useless to ask Madame Ratignolle, who was on the most distant terms with the musician, and preferred to know nothing concerning her. ", "She had once been almost as emphatic in expressing herself upon the subject as the corner grocer. ", "Edna knew that Madame Lebrun had returned to the city, for it was the middle of November. ", "And she also knew where the Lebruns lived, on Chartres Street. ", "Their home from the outside looked like a prison, with iron bars before the door and lower windows. ", "The iron bars were a relic of the old regime, and no one had ever thought of dislodging them. ", "At the side was a high fence enclosing the garden. ", "A gate or door opening upon the street was locked. ", "Edna rang the bell at this side garden gate, and stood upon the banquette, waiting to be admitted. ", "It was Victor who opened the gate for her. ", "A black woman, wiping her hands upon her apron, was close at his heels. ", "Before she saw them Edna could hear them in altercation, the woman-plainly an anomaly-claiming the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to answer the bell. ", "Victor was surprised and delighted to see Mrs. Pontellier, and he made no attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight. ", "He was a dark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling his mother, but with ten times her impetuosity. ", "He instructed the black woman to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier desired to see her. ", "The woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty when she had not been permitted to do it all, and started back to her interrupted task of weeding the garden. ", "Whereupon Victor administered a rebuke in the form of a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity and incoherence, was all but incomprehensible to Edna. ", "Whatever it was, the rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went mumbling into the house. ", "Edna did not wish to enter. ", "It was very pleasant there on the side porch, where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table. ", "She seated herself, for she was tired from her long tramp; ", "and she began to rock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol. ", "Victor drew up his chair beside her. ", "He at once explained that the black woman's offensive conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not there to take her in hand. ", "He had only come up from the island the morning before, and expected to return next day. ", "He stayed all winter at the island; ", "he lived there, and kept the place in order and got things ready for the summer visitors. ", "But a man needed occasional relaxation, he informed Mrs. Pontellier, and every now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the city. ", "My! ", "but he had had a time of it the evening before! ", "He wouldn't want his mother to know, and he began to talk in a whisper. ", "He was scintillant with recollections. ", "Of course, he couldn't think of telling Mrs. Pontellier all about it, she being a woman and not comprehending such things. ", "But it all began with a girl peeping and smiling at him through the shutters as he passed by. ", "Oh! ", "but she was a beauty! ", "Certainly he smiled back, and went up and talked to her. ", "Mrs. Pontellier did not know him if she supposed he was one to let an opportunity like that escape him. ", "Despite herself, the youngster amused her. ", "She must have betrayed in her look some degree of interest or entertainment. ", "The boy grew more daring, and Mrs. Pontellier might have found herself, in a little while, listening to a highly colored story but for the timely appearance of Madame Lebrun. ", "That lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the summer. ", "Her eyes beamed an effusive welcome. ", "Would not Mrs. Pontellier go inside? ", "Would she partake of some refreshment? ", "Why had she not been there before? ", "How was that dear Mr. Pontellier and how were those sweet children? ", "Had Mrs. Pontellier ever known such a warm November? ", "Victor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother's chair, where he commanded a view of Edna's face. ", "He had taken her parasol from her hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and twirled it above him as he lay on his back. ", "When Madame Lebrun complained that it was _so_ dull coming back to the city; ", "that she saw _so_ few people now; ", "that even Victor, when he came up from the island for a day or two, had _so_ much to occupy him and engage his time; ", "then it was that the youth went into contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at Edna. ", "She somehow felt like a confederate in crime, and tried to look severe and disapproving. ", "There had been but two letters from Robert, with little in them, they told her. ", "Victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for the letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them. ", "He remembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when put to the test. ", "One letter was written from Vera Cruz and the other from the City of Mexico. ", "He had met Montel, who was doing everything toward his advancement. ", "So far, the financial situation was no improvement over the one he had left in New Orleans, but of course the prospects were vastly better. ", "He wrote of the City of Mexico, the buildings, the people and their habits, the conditions of life which he found there. ", "He sent his love to the family. ", "He inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she would affectionately remember him to all his friends. ", "That was about the substance of the two letters. ", "Edna felt that if there had been a message for her, she would have received it. ", "The despondent frame of mind in which she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered that she wished to find Mademoiselle Reisz. ", "Madame Lebrun knew where Mademoiselle Reisz lived. ", "She gave Edna the address, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the remainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to Mademoiselle Reisz some other day. ", "The afternoon was already well advanced. ", "Victor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held it over her while he walked to the car with her. ", "He entreated her to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential. ", "She laughed and bantered him a little, remembering too late that she should have been dignified and reserved. ", "\"How handsome Mrs. Pontellier looked!\" said Madame Lebrun to her son. ", "Ravishing!\" ", "he admitted. ", "\" The city atmosphere has improved her. ", "Some way she doesn't seem like the same woman.\" ", "XXI   Some people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars, peddlars and callers. ", "There were plenty of windows in her little front room. ", "They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always open it did not make so much difference. ", "They often admitted into the room a good deal of smoke and soot; ", "but at the same time all the light and air that there was came through them. ", "From her windows could be seen the crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the Mississippi steamers. ", "A magnificent piano crowded the apartment. ", "In the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the neighboring restaurant. ", "It was there also that she ate, keeping her belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred years of use. ", "When Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz's front room door and entered, she discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in mending or patching an old prunella gaiter. ", "The little musician laughed all over when she saw Edna. ", "Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body. ", "She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the afternoon light. ", "She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head. ", "So you remembered me at last,\" said Mademoiselle. ", "\" I had said to myself, 'Ah, bah! ", "she will never come.'\" ", "\"Did you want me to come?\" asked Edna with a smile. ", "\"I had not thought much about it,\" answered Mademoiselle. ", "The two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall. ", "\"I am glad, however, that you came. ", "I have the water boiling back there, and was just about to make some coffee. ", "You will drink a cup with me. ", "And how is la belle dame? ", "Always handsome! always healthy! ", "always contented!\" ", "She took Edna's hand between her strong wiry fingers, holding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm. \" ", "Yes,\" she went on; ", "I sometimes thought: ", "She will never come. ", "She promised as those women in society always do, without meaning it. ", "She will not come.' ", "For I really don't believe you like me, Mrs. Pontellier. ", "\"I don't know whether I like you or not,\" replied Edna, gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look. ", "The candor of Mrs. Pontellier's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle Reisz. ", "She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee. ", "The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun's and was now beginning to feel hungry. ", "Mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa. ", "\"I have had a letter from your friend,\" she remarked, as she poured a little cream into Edna's cup and handed it to her. ", "My friend?\" ", "\"Yes, your friend Robert.

", "XXII    ", "One morning on his way into town Mr. Pontellier stopped at the house of his old friend and family physician, Doctor Mandelet. ", "The Doctor was a semi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels. ", "He bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill-leaving the active practice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries-and was much sought for in matters of consultation. ", "A few families, united to him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the services of a physician. ", "The Pontelliers were among these. ", "Mr. Pontellier found the Doctor reading at the open window of his study. ", "His house stood rather far back from the street, in the center of a delightful garden, so that it was quiet and peaceful at the old gentleman's study window. ", "He was a great reader. ", "He stared up disapprovingly over his eye-glasses as Mr. Pontellier entered, wondering who had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the morning. ", "\"Ah, Pontellier! ", "Not sick, I hope. ", "Come and have a seat. ", "What news do you bring this morning? ", "\" He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray hair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but none of their penetration. ", "Oh! ", "I'm never sick, Doctor. ", "You know that I come of tough fiber-of that old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away. ", "I came to consult-no, not precisely to consult-to talk to you about Edna. ", "I don't know what ails her.\" ", "\"Madame Pontellier not well,\" marveled the Doctor. ", "\" Why, I saw her-I think it was a week ago-walking along Canal Street, the picture of health, it seemed to me.\" ", "\"Yes, yes; ", "she seems quite well,\" said Mr. Pontellier, leaning forward and whirling his stick between his two hands; ", "but she doesn't act well. ", "She's odd, she's not like herself. ", "I can't make her out, and I thought perhaps you'd help me.\" ", "\"How does she act?\" inquired the Doctor. ", "Well, it isn't easy to explain,\" said Mr. Pontellier, throwing himself back in his chair. ", "\" She lets the housekeeping go to the dickens.\" ", "\"Well, well; ", "women are not all alike, my dear Pontellier. ", "We've got to consider-\"  \"I know that ", "I told you I couldn't explain. ", "Her whole attitude-toward me and everybody and everything-has changed. ", "You know I have a quick temper, but I don't want to quarrel or be rude to a woman, especially my wife; ", "yet I'm driven to it, and feel like ten thousand devils after I've made a fool of myself. ", "She's making it devilishly uncomfortable for me,\" he went on nervously. ", "\" She's got some sort of notion in her head concerning the eternal rights of women; ", "and-you understand-we meet in the morning at the breakfast table. ", "\" The old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows, protruded his thick nether lip, and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned fingertips. ", "\"What have you been doing to her, Pontellier?\" ", "\"Doing! Parbleu!\" ", "\"Has she,\" asked the Doctor, with a smile, \"has she been associating of late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women-super-spiritual superior beings? ", "My wife has been telling me about them.\" ", "\"That's the trouble,\" broke in Mr. Pontellier, \"she hasn't been associating with any one. ", "She has abandoned her Tuesdays at home, has thrown over all her acquaintances, and goes tramping about by herself, moping in the street-cars, getting in after dark. ", "I tell you she's peculiar. ", "I don't like it; ", "I feel a little worried over it. ", "\" This was a new aspect for the Doctor. \" ", "Nothing hereditary?\" ", "he asked, seriously. ", "Nothing peculiar about her family antecedents, is there?\" ", "\"Oh, no, indeed! ", "She comes of sound old Presbyterian Kentucky stock. ", "The old gentleman, her father, I have heard, used to atone for his weekday sins with his Sunday devotions. ", "I know for a fact, that his race horses literally ran away with the prettiest bit of Kentucky farming land I ever laid eyes upon. ", "Margaret-you know Margaret-she has all the Presbyterianism undiluted. ", "And the youngest is something of a vixen. ", "By the way, she gets married in a couple of weeks from now.\" ", "\"Send your wife up to the wedding,\" exclaimed the Doctor, foreseeing a happy solution. ", "Let her stay among her own people for a while; ", "it will do her good.\" ", "\"That's what I want her to do. ", "She won't go to the marriage. ", "She says a wedding is one of the most lamentable spectacles on earth. ", "Nice thing for a woman to say to her husband!\" exclaimed Mr. Pontellier, fuming anew at the recollection. ", "Pontellier,\" said the Doctor, after a moment's reflection, \"let your wife alone for a while. ", "Don't bother her, and don't let her bother you. ", "Woman, my dear friend, is a very peculiar and delicate organism-a sensitive and highly organized woman, such as I know Mrs. Pontellier to be, is especially peculiar. ", "It would require an inspired psychologist to deal successfully with them. ", "And when ordinary fellows like you and me attempt to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling. ", "Most women are moody and whimsical. ", "This is some passing whim of your wife, due to some cause or causes which you and I needn't try to fathom. ", "But it will pass happily over, especially if you let her alone. ", "Send her around to see me.\" ", "\"Oh! ", "I couldn't do that; ", "there'd be no reason for it,\" objected Mr. Pontellier. ", "\"Then I'll go around and see her,\" said the Doctor. ", "\" I'll drop in to dinner some evening en bon ami.\" ", "\"Do! by all means,\" urged Mr. Pontellier. ", "\" What evening will you come? ", "Say Thursday. ", "Will you come Thursday?\" ", "he asked, rising to take his leave. ", "Very well; ", "Thursday. ", "My wife may possibly have some engagement for me Thursday. ", "In case she has, I shall let you know. ", "Otherwise, you may expect me.\" ", "Mr. Pontellier turned before leaving to say: ", "\"I am going to New York on business very soon. ", "I have a big scheme on hand, and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle the ribbons. ", "We'll let you in on the inside if you say so, Doctor,\" he laughed. ", "\"No, I thank you, my dear sir,\" returned the Doctor. ", "\" I leave such ventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your blood.\" ", "\"What I wanted to say,\" continued Mr. Pontellier, with his hand on the knob; ", "\"I may have to be absent a good while. ", "Would you advise me to take Edna along?\" ", "\"By all means, if she wishes to go. ", "If not, leave her here. ", "Don't contradict her. ", "The mood will pass, I assure you. ", "It may take a month, two, three months-possibly longer, but it will pass; ", "have patience.\" ", "\"Well, good-by, a jeudi,\" said Mr. Pontellier, as he let himself out. ", "The Doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask, \"Is there any man in the case?\" ", "but he knew his Creole too well to make such a blunder as that. ", "He did not resume his book immediately, but sat for a while meditatively looking out into the garden. ", "XXIII    ", "Edna's father was in the city, and had been with them several days. ", "She was not very warmly or deeply attached to him, but they had certain tastes in common, and when together they were companionable. ", "His coming was in the nature of a welcome disturbance; ", "it seemed to furnish a new direction for her emotions. ", "He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter, Janet, and an outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her marriage. ", "Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift, as every one immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such matters. ", "And his suggestions on the question of dress-which too often assumes the nature of a problem-were of inestimable value to his father-in-law. ", "But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon Edna's hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations. ", "He had been a colonel in the Confederate army, and still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always accompanied it. ", "His hair and mustache were white and silky, emphasizing the rugged bronze of his face. ", "He was tall and thin, and wore his coats padded, which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders and chest. ", "Edna and her father looked very distinguished together, and excited a good deal of notice during their perambulations. ", "Upon his arrival she began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch of him. ", "He took the whole matter very seriously. ", "If her talent had been ten-fold greater than it was, it would not have surprised him, convinced as he was that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful capability, which only depended upon their own efforts to be directed toward successful achievement. ", "Before her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching, as he had faced the cannon's mouth in days gone by. ", "He resented the intrusion of the children, who gaped with wondering eyes at him, sitting so stiff up there in their mother's bright atelier. ", "When they drew near he motioned them away with an expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the fixed lines of his countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders. ", "Edna, anxious to entertain him, invited Mademoiselle Reisz to meet him, having promised him a treat in her piano playing; ", "but Mademoiselle declined the invitation. ", "So together they attended a soiree musicale at the Ratignolles'. ", "Monsieur and Madame Ratignolle made much of the Colonel, installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at once to dine with them the following Sunday, or any day which he might select. ", "Madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive manner, with eyes, gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the Colonel's old head felt thirty years younger on his padded shoulders. ", "Edna marveled, not comprehending. ", "She herself was almost devoid of coquetry. ", "There were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale; ", "but she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract their notice-to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward them. ", "Their personality attracted her in an agreeable way. ", "Her fancy selected them, and she was glad when a lull in the music gave them an opportunity to meet her and talk with her. ", "Often on the street the glance of strange eyes had lingered in her memory, and sometimes had disturbed her. ", "Mr. Pontellier did not attend these soirees musicales. ", "He considered them bourgeois, and found more diversion at the club. ", "To Madame Ratignolle he said the music dispensed at her soirees was too \"heavy,\"  too far beyond his untrained comprehension. ", "His excuse flattered her. ", "But she disapproved of Mr. Pontellier's club, and she was frank enough to tell Edna so. ", "\"It's a pity Mr. Pontellier doesn't stay home more in the evenings. ", "I think you would be more-well, if you don't mind my saying it-more united, if he did.\" ", "\"Oh! dear no!\" said Edna, with a blank look in her eyes. ", "\" What should I do if he stayed home? ", "We wouldn't have anything to say to each other. ", "\" She had not much of anything to say to her father, for that matter; ", "but he did not antagonize her. ", "She discovered that he interested her, though she realized that he might not interest her long; ", "and for the first time in her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him. ", "He kept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants. ", "It amused her to do so. ", "She would not permit a servant or one of the children to do anything for him which she might do herself. ", "Her husband noticed, and thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had never suspected. ", "The Colonel drank numerous \"toddies\" during the course of the day, which left him, however, imperturbed. ", "He was an expert at concocting strong drinks. ", "He had even invented some, to which he had given fantastic names, and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it devolved upon Edna to procure for him. ", "When Doctor Mandelet dined with the Pontelliers on Thursday he could discern in Mrs. Pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her husband had reported to him. ", "She was excited and in a manner radiant. ", "She and her father had been to the race course, and their thoughts when they seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of the afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. ", "The Doctor had not kept pace with turf affairs. ", "He had certain recollections of racing in what he called \"the good old times\" when the Lecompte stables flourished, and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. ", "But he failed to impose upon the Colonel, and was even far from impressing him with this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. ", "Edna had staked her father on his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them. ", "Besides, they had met some very charming people, according to the Colonel's impressions. ", "Mrs. Mortimer Merriman and Mrs. James Highcamp, who were there with Alcee Arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of. ", "Mr. Pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially when he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in Kentucky. ", "He endeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and only succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law. ", "A pretty dispute followed, in which Edna warmly espoused her father's cause and the Doctor remained neutral. ", "He observed his hostess attentively from under his shaggy brows, and noted a subtle change which had transformed her from the listless woman he had known into a being who, for the moment, seemed palpitant with the forces of life. ", "Her speech was warm and energetic. ", "There was no repression in her glance or gesture. ", "She reminded him of some beautiful, sleek animal waking up in the sun. ", "The dinner was excellent. ", "The claret was warm and the champagne was cold, and under their beneficent influence the threatened unpleasantness melted and vanished with the fumes of the wine. ", "Mr. Pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent. ", "He told some amusing plantation experiences, recollections of old Iberville and his youth, when he hunted 'possum in company with some friendly darky; ", "thrashed the pecan trees, shot the grosbec, and roamed the woods and fields in mischievous idleness. ", "The Colonel, with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things, related a somber episode of those dark and bitter days, in which he had acted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure. ", "Nor was the Doctor happier in his selection, when he told the old, ever new and curious story of the waning of a woman's love, seeking strange, new channels, only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce unrest. ", "It was one of the many little human documents which had been unfolded to him during his long career as a physician. ", "The story did not seem especially to impress Edna. ", "She had one of her own to tell, of a woman who paddled away with her lover one night in a pirogue and never came back. ", "They were lost amid the Baratarian Islands, and no one ever heard of them or found trace of them from that day to this. ", "It was a pure invention. ", "She said that Madame Antoine had related it to her. ", "That, also, was an invention. ", "Perhaps it was a dream she had had. ", "But every glowing word seemed real to those who listened. ", "They could feel the hot breath of the Southern night; ", "they could hear the long sweep of the pirogue through the glistening moonlit water, the beating of birds' wings, rising startled from among the reeds in the salt-water pools; ", "they could see the faces of the lovers, pale, close together, rapt in oblivious forgetfulness, drifting into the unknown. ", "The champagne was cold, and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks with Edna's memory that night. ", "Outside, away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight, the night was chill and murky. ", "The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak across his breast as he strode home through the darkness. ", "He knew his fellow-creatures better than most men; ", "knew that inner life which so seldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. ", "He was sorry he had accepted Pontellier's invitation. ", "He was growing old, and beginning to need rest and an imperturbed spirit. ", "He did not want the secrets of other lives thrust upon him. ", "\"I hope it isn't Arobin,\" he muttered to himself as he walked. ", "\" I hope to heaven it isn't Alcee Arobin. ", "\" XXIV   Edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the subject of her refusal to attend her sister's wedding. ", "Mr. Pontellier declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his authority. ", "He was following Doctor Mandelet's advice, and letting her do as she liked. ", "The Colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of filial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly consideration. ", "His arguments were labored and unconvincing. ", "He doubted if Janet would accept any excuse-forgetting that Edna had offered none. ", "He doubted if Janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure Margaret would not. ", "Edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself off with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded shoulders, his Bible reading, his \"toddies\" and ponderous oaths. ", "Mr. Pontellier followed him closely. ", "He meant to stop at the wedding on his way to New York and endeavor by every means which money and love could devise to atone somewhat for Edna's incomprehensible action. ", "\"You are too lenient, too lenient by far, Leonce,\" asserted the Colonel. ", "\"Authority, coercion are what is needed. ", "Put your foot down good and hard; ", "the only way to manage a wife. ", "Take my word for it.\" ", "The Colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into her grave. ", "Mr. Pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought it needless to mention at that late day. ", "Edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father. ", "As the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment. ", "She was solicitous about his health and his welfare. ", "She bustled around, looking after his clothing, thinking about heavy underwear, quite as Madame Ratignolle would have done under similar circumstances. ", "She cried when he went away, calling him her dear, good friend, and she was quite certain she would grow lonely before very long and go to join him in New York. ", "But after all, a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found herself alone. ", "Even the children were gone. ", "Old Madame Pontellier had come herself and carried them off to Iberville with their quadroon. ", "The old madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be neglected during Leonce's absence; ", "she hardly ventured to think so. ", "She was hungry for them-even a little fierce in her attachment. ", "She did not want them to be wholly \"children of the pavement,\" she always said when begging to have them for a space. ", "She wished them to know the country, with its streams, its fields, its woods, its freedom, so delicious to the young. ", "She wished them to taste something of the life their father had lived and known and loved when he, too, was a little child. ", "When Edna was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of relief. ", "A feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her. ", "She walked all through the house, from one room to another, as if inspecting it for the first time. ", "She tried the various chairs and lounges, as if she had never sat and reclined upon them before. ", "And she perambulated around the outside of the house, investigating, looking to see if windows and shutters were secure and in order. ", "The flowers were like new acquaintances; ", "she approached them in a familiar spirit, and made herself at home among them. ", "The garden walks were damp, and Edna called to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals. ", "And there she stayed, and stooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves. ", "The children's little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way. ", "She scolded him, laughed at him, played with him. ", "The garden smelled so good and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight. ", "Edna plucked all the bright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she and the little dog. ", "Even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had never before perceived. ", "She went in to give directions to the cook, to say that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they would require only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and groceries. ", "She told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied during Mr. Pontellier's absence, and she begged her to take all thought and responsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders. ", "That night Edna dined alone. ", "The candelabra, with a few candles in the center of the table, gave all the light she needed. ", "Outside the circle of light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and shadowy. ", "The cook, placed upon her mettle, served a delicious repast-a luscious tenderloin broiled a point. ", "The wine tasted good; ", "the marron glace seemed to be just what she wanted. ", "It was so pleasant, too, to dine in a comfortable peignoir. ", "She thought a little sentimentally about Leonce and the children, and wondered what they were doing. ", "As she gave a dainty scrap or two to the doggie, she talked intimately to him about Etienne and Raoul. ", "He was beside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable advances, and showed his appreciation by his little quick, snappy barks and a lively agitation. ", "Then Edna sat in the library after dinner and read Emerson until she grew sleepy. ", "She realized that she had neglected her reading, and determined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that her time was completely her own to do with as she liked. ", "After a refreshing bath, Edna went to bed. ", "And as she snuggled comfortably beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her, such as she had not known before. ", "XXV   When the weather was dark and cloudy Edna could not work. ", "She needed the sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. ", "She had reached a stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way, working, when in the humor, with sureness and ease. ", "And being devoid of ambition, and striving not toward accomplishment, she drew satisfaction from the work in itself. ", "On rainy or melancholy days Edna went out and sought the society of the friends she had made at Grand Isle. ", "Or else she stayed indoors and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own comfort and peace of mind. ", "It was not despair; ", "but it seemed to her as if life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled. ", "Yet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by fresh promises which her youth held out to her. ", "She went again to the races, and again. ", "Alcee Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp called for her one bright afternoon in Arobin's drag. ", "Mrs. Highcamp was a worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the forties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. ", "She had a daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of young men of fashion. ", "Alcee Arobin was one of them. ", "He was a familiar figure at the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. ", "There was a perpetual smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to awaken a corresponding cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened to his good-humored voice. ", "His manner was quiet, and at times a little insolent. ", "He possessed a good figure, a pleasing face, not overburdened with depth of thought or feeling; ", "and his dress was that of the conventional man of fashion. ", "He admired Edna extravagantly, after meeting her at the races with her father. ", "He had met her before on other occasions, but she had seemed to him unapproachable until that day. ", "It was at his instigation that Mrs. Highcamp called to ask her to go with them to the Jockey Club to witness the turf event of the season. ", "There were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as well as Edna, but there was certainly none who knew it better. ", "She sat between her two companions as one having authority to speak. ", "She laughed at Arobin's pretensions, and deplored Mrs. Highcamp's ignorance. ", "The race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood. ", "The atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils. ", "She did not perceive that she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in review before them. ", "She played for very high stakes, and fortune favored her. ", "The fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes, and it got into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant. ", "People turned their heads to look at her, and more than one lent an attentive ear to her utterances, hoping thereby to secure the elusive but ever-desired \"tip.\" ", "Arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to Edna like a magnet. ", "Mrs. Highcamp remained, as usual, unmoved, with her indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows. ", "Edna stayed and dined with Mrs. Highcamp upon being urged to do so. ", "Arobin also remained and sent away his drag. ", "The dinner was quiet and uninteresting, save for the cheerful efforts of Arobin to enliven things. ", "Mrs. Highcamp deplored the absence of her daughter from the races, and tried to convey to her what she had missed by going to the \"Dante reading\" instead of joining them. ", "The girl held a geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing, but looked knowing and noncommittal. ", "Mr. Highcamp was a plain, bald-headed man, who only talked under compulsion. ", "He was unresponsive. ", "Mrs. Highcamp was full of delicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband. ", "She addressed most of her conversation to him at table. ", "They sat in the library after dinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight; ", "while the younger people went into the drawing-room near by and talked. ", "Miss Highcamp played some selections from Grieg upon the piano. ", "She seemed to have apprehended all of the composer's coldness and none of his poetry. ", "While Edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music. ", "When the time came for her to go home, Mr. Highcamp grunted a lame offer to escort her, looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern. ", "It was Arobin who took her home. ", "The car ride was long, and it was late when they reached Esplanade Street. ", "Arobin asked permission to enter for a second to light his cigarette-his match safe was empty. ", "He filled his match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again. ", "Edna was neither tired nor sleepy. ", "She was hungry again, for the Highcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. ", "She rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers. ", "She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox. ", "Edna felt extremely restless and excited.

", "Can I refuse you anything? ", "Oh! ", "you cannot deceive me,\" and Mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and began to play. ", "Edna did not at once read the letter. ", "She sat holding it in her hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an effulgence, warming and brightening the dark places of her soul. ", "It prepared her for joy and exultation. \" ", "Oh!\" ", "she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. ", "\" Why did you not tell me?\" ", "She went and grasped Mademoiselle's hands up from the keys. \" ", "Oh! unkind! malicious! ", "Why did you not tell me?\" ", "\"That he was coming back? ", "No great news, ma foi. ", "I wonder he did not come long ago.\" ", "\"But when, when?\" cried Edna, impatiently. \" ", "He does not say when.\" ", "\"He says 'very soon.'

", "Oh, if I thought-\" ", "and she snatched the letter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way, looking for the reason, which was left untold. ", "\"If I were young and in love with a man,\" said Mademoiselle, turning on the stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked down at Edna, who sat on the floor holding the letter, \"it seems to me he would have to be some grand esprit; ", "a man with lofty aims and ability to reach them; ", "one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his fellow-men.

", "\" Why do you love him when you ought not to?\" ", "Edna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before Mademoiselle Reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands. \" ", "Why?

", "Because-\"  \"Because you do, in short,\" laughed Mademoiselle. ", "\" What will you do when he comes back?\" ", "she asked. \" ", "Do? ", "Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive. ", "\" She was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his return. ", "The murky, lowering sky, which had depressed her a few hours before, seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the streets on her way home. ", "She stopped at a confectioner's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the children in Iberville. ", "She slipped a card in the box, on which she scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses. ", "Before dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her husband, telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house around the block, and to give a farewell dinner before leaving, regretting that he was not there to share it, to help out with the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests. ", "Her letter was brilliant and brimming with cheerfulness. ", "XXVII    ", "What is the matter with you?\" asked Arobin that evening. ", "\" I never found you in such a happy mood.

", "\" You wouldn't give me another if I sat here all night imploring you.\" ", "He sat close to her on a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that fell a little over her forehead. ", "She liked the touch of his fingers through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.

", "What's the use? ", "Why should you bother thinking about it when I can tell you what manner of woman you are.\" ", "His fingers strayed occasionally down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was growing a little full and double.

", "Spare yourself the effort.\" ", "\"No; ", "I shan't tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn't be lying if I did.\" ", "\"Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz?\" ", "she asked irrelevantly.

", "They're making you a little kinder than usual; ", "but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if they were not here with me. ", "\" She only looked at him and smiled. ", "His eyes were very near. ", "He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across her, while the other hand still rested upon her hair. ", "They continued silently to look into each other's eyes. ", "When he leaned forward and kissed her, she clasped his head, holding his lips to hers. ", "It was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really responded. ", "It was a flaming torch that kindled desire. ", "XXVIII    ", "Edna cried a little that night after Arobin left her. ", "It was only one phase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her. ", "There was with her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility. ", "There was the shock of the unexpected and the unaccustomed. ", "There was her husband's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence. ", "There was Robert's reproach making itself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had awakened within her toward him. ", "Above all, there was understanding. ", "She felt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes, enabling her to look upon and comprehend the significance of life, that monster made up of beauty and brutality. ", "But among the conflicting sensations which assailed her, there was neither shame nor remorse. ", "There was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her, because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips. ", "XXIX    ", "Without even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his opinion or wishes in the matter, Edna hastened her preparations for quitting her home on Esplanade Street and moving into the little house around the block. ", "A feverish anxiety attended her every action in that direction. ", "There was no moment of deliberation, no interval of repose between the thought and its fulfillment. ", "Early upon the morning following those hours passed in Arobin's society, Edna set about securing her new abode and hurrying her arrangements for occupying it. ", "Within the precincts of her home she felt like one who has entered and lingered within the portals of some forbidden temple in which a thousand muffled voices bade her begone. ", "Whatever was her own in the house, everything which she had acquired aside from her husband's bounty, she caused to be transported to the other house, supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own resources. ", "Arobin found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the house-maid when he looked in during the afternoon. ", "She was splendid and robust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her hair from the dust. ", "She was mounted upon a high stepladder, unhooking a picture from the wall when he entered. ", "He had found the front door open, and had followed his ring by walking in unceremoniously. \" ", "Come down!\" ", "he said. ", "\" Do you want to kill yourself?\" ", "She greeted him with affected carelessness, and appeared absorbed in her occupation. ", "If he had expected to find her languishing, reproachful, or indulging in sentimental tears, he must have been greatly surprised. ", "He was no doubt prepared for any emergency, ready for any one of the foregoing attitudes, just as he bent himself easily and naturally to the situation which confronted him. ", "Please come down,\" he insisted, holding the ladder and looking up at her. ", "No,\" she answered; ", "Ellen is afraid to mount the ladder. ", "Joe is working over at the 'pigeon house'-that's the name Ellen gives it, because it's so small and looks like a pigeon house-and some one has to do this.\" ", "Arobin pulled off his coat, and expressed himself ready and willing to tempt fate in her place. ", "Ellen brought him one of her dust-caps, and went into contortions of mirth, which she found it impossible to control, when she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as he could. ", "Edna herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened it at his request. ", "So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder, unhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as Edna directed. ", "When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to wash his hands. ", "Edna was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather duster along the carpet when he came in again. \" ", "Is there anything more you will let me do?\" ", "he asked. ", "\"That is all,\" she answered. \" ", "Ellen can manage the rest. ", "She kept the young woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone with Arobin. ", "\"What about the dinner?\" ", "he asked; ", "\"the grand event, the coup d'etat?\" ", "\"It will be day after to-morrow. ", "Why do you call it the 'coup d'etat?' ", "Oh! it will be very fine; ", "all my best of everything-crystal, silver and gold, Sevres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. ", "I'll let Leonce pay the bills. ", "I wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills.\" ", "\"And you ask me why I call it a coup d'etat?\" ", "Arobin had put on his coat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb. ", "She told him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar. ", "\"When do you go to the 'pigeon house?'-with all due acknowledgment to Ellen.\" ", "\"Day after to-morrow, after the dinner. ", "I shall sleep there.\" ", "\"Ellen, will you very kindly get me a glass of water?\" asked Arobin. ", "\"The dust in the curtains, if you will pardon me for hinting such a thing, has parched my throat to a crisp.\" ", "\"While Ellen gets the water,\" said Edna, rising, \"I will say good-by and let you go. ", "I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million things to do and think of.\" ", "\"When shall I see you?\" asked Arobin, seeking to detain her, the maid having left the room. ", "\"At the dinner, of course. ", "You are invited.\" ", "\"Not before?-not to-night or to-morrow morning or to-morrow noon or night? or the day after morning or noon? ", "Can't you see yourself, without my telling you, what an eternity it is?\" ", "He had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway, looking up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him. ", "\"Not an instant sooner,\" she said. ", "But she laughed and looked at him with eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to wait. ", "XXX    ", "Though Edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair, it was in truth a very small affair and very select, in so much as the guests invited were few and were selected with discrimination. ", "She had counted upon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board, forgetting for the moment that Madame Ratignolle was to the last degree souffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that Madame Lebrun would send a thousand regrets at the last moment. ", "So there were only ten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number. ", "There were Mr. and Mrs. Merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in the thirties; ", "her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate, who laughed a good deal at other people's witticisms, and had thereby made himself extremely popular. ", "Mrs. Highcamp had accompanied them. ", "Of course, there was Alcee Arobin; ", "and Mademoiselle Reisz had consented to come. ", "Edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace trimmings for her hair. ", "Monsieur Ratignolle brought himself and his wife's excuses. ", "Victor Lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. ", "There was a Miss Mayblunt, no longer in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with the keenest interest. ", "It was thought and said that she was intellectual; ", "it was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guerre. ", "She had come with a gentleman by the name of Gouvernail, connected with one of the daily papers, of whom nothing special could be said, except that he was observant and seemed quiet and inoffensive. ", "Edna herself made the tenth, and at half-past eight they seated themselves at table, Arobin and Monsieur Ratignolle on either side of their hostess. ", "Mrs. Highcamp sat between Arobin and Victor Lebrun. ", "Then came Mrs. Merriman, Mr. Gouvernail, Miss Mayblunt, Mr. Merriman, and Mademoiselle Reisz next to Monsieur Ratignolle. ", "There was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the table, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin under strips of lace-work. ", "There were wax candles, in massive brass candelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; ", "full, fragrant roses, yellow and red, abounded. ", "There were silver and gold, as she had said there would be, and crystal which glittered like the gems which the women wore. ", "The ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected throughout the house. ", "Mademoiselle Reisz, being exceedingly diminutive, was elevated upon cushions, as small children are sometimes hoisted at table upon bulky volumes. ", "\"Something new, Edna?\" exclaimed Miss Mayblunt, with lorgnette directed toward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled, that almost sputtered, in Edna's hair, just over the center of her forehead. \" ", "Quite new; ", "brand' new, in fact; ", "a present from my husband. ", "It arrived this morning from New York. ", "I may as well admit that this is my birthday, and that I am twenty-nine. ", "In good time I expect you to drink my health. ", "Meanwhile, I shall ask you to begin with this cocktail, composed-would you say 'composed?'\" with an appeal to Miss Mayblunt-\"composed by my father in honor of Sister Janet's wedding. ", "Before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a garnet gem. ", "Then, all things considered,\" spoke Arobin, \"it might not be amiss to start out by drinking the Colonel's health in the cocktail which he composed, on the birthday of the most charming of women-the daughter whom he invented.\" ", "Mr. Merriman's laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so contagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never slackened. ", "Miss Mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before her, just to look at. ", "The color was marvelous! ", "She could compare it to nothing she had ever seen, and the garnet lights which it emitted were unspeakably rare. ", "She pronounced the Colonel an artist, and stuck to it. ", "Monsieur Ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously; ", "the mets, the entre-mets, the service, the decorations, even the people. ", "He looked up from his pompano and inquired of Arobin if he were related to the gentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of Laitner and Arobin, lawyers.

", "They made up together for instance some twelve feet three of stature, and nothing was more discussed than the apportionment of this quantity. ", "The sole flaw in Ida's beauty was a length and reach of arm conducive perhaps to her having so often beaten her ex-husband at billiards, a game in which she showed a superiority largely accountable, as she maintained, for the resentment finding expression in his physical violence. ", "Billiards was her great accomplishment and the distinction her name always first produced the mention of. ", "Notwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might have been large and that in many women profited by the licence was, with a single exception, admired and cited for its smallness. ", "The exception was her eyes, which might have been of mere regulation size, but which overstepped the modesty of nature; ", "her mouth, on the other hand, was barely perceptible, and odds were freely taken as to the measurement of her waist.

", "Only a drummer-boy in a ballad or a story could have been so in the thick of the fight.

", "She was in short introduced to life with a liberality in which the selfishness of others found its account, and there was nothing to avert the sacrifice but the modesty of her youth. ", "Her first term was with her father, who spared her only in not letting her have the wild letters addressed to her by her mother: ", "he confined himself to holding them up at her and shaking them, while he showed his teeth, and then amusing her by the way he chucked them, across the room, bang into the fire. ", "Even at that moment, however, she had a scared anticipation of fatigue, a guilty sense of not rising to the occasion, feeling the charm of the violence with which the stiff unopened envelopes, whose big monograms-Ida bristled with monograms-she would have liked to see, were made to whizz, like dangerous missiles, through the air. ", "The greatest effect of the great cause was her own greater importance, chiefly revealed to her in the larger freedom with which she was handled, pulled hither and thither and kissed, and the proportionately greater niceness she was obliged to show. ", "Her features had somehow become prominent; ", "they were so perpetually nipped by the gentlemen who came to see her father and the smoke of whose cigarettes went into her face. ", "Some of these gentlemen made her strike matches and light their cigarettes; ", "others, holding her on knees violently jolted, pinched the calves of her legs till she shrieked-her shriek was much admired-and reproached them with being toothpicks. ", "The word stuck in her mind and contributed to her feeling from this time that she was deficient in something that would meet the general desire. ", "She found out what it was: ", "it was a congenital tendency to the production of a substance to which Moddle, her nurse, gave a short ugly name, a name painfully associated at dinner with the part of the joint that she didn't like. ", "She had left behind her the time when she had no desires to meet, none at least save Moddle's, who, in Kensington Gardens, was always on the bench when she came back to see if she had been playing too far. ", "Moddle's desire was merely that she shouldn't do that, and she met it so easily that the only spots in that long brightness were the moments of her wondering what would become of her if, on her rushing back, there should be no Moddle on the bench. ", "They still went to the Gardens, but there was a difference even there; ", "she was impelled perpetually to look at the legs of other children and ask her nurse if they were toothpicks. ", "Moddle was terribly truthful; ", "she always said: ", "Oh my dear, you'll not find such another pair as your own. ", "\" It seemed to have to do with something else that Moddle often said: ", "You feel the strain-that's where it is; ", "and you'll feel it still worse, you know. ", "Thus from the first Maisie not only felt it, but knew she felt it. ", "A part of it was the consequence of her father's telling her he felt it too, and telling Moddle, in her presence, that she must make a point of driving that home. ", "She was familiar, at the age of six, with the fact that everything had been changed on her account, everything ordered to enable him to give himself up to her. ", "She was to remember always the words in which Moddle impressed upon her that he did so give himself: ", "Your papa wishes you never to forget, you know, that he has been dreadfully put about. ", "\" If the skin on Moddle's face had to Maisie the air of being unduly, almost painfully, stretched, it never presented that appearance so much as when she uttered, as she often had occasion to utter, such words. ", "The child wondered if they didn't make it hurt more than usual; ", "but it was only after some time that she was able to attach to the picture of her father's sufferings, and more particularly to her nurse's manner about them, the meaning for which these things had waited. ", "By the time she had grown sharper, as the gentlemen who had criticised her calves used to say, she found in her mind a collection of images and echoes to which meanings were attachable-images and echoes kept for her in the childish dusk, the dim closet, the high drawers, like games she wasn't yet big enough to play. ", "The great strain meanwhile was that of carrying by the right end the things her father said about her mother-things mostly indeed that Moddle, on a glimpse of them, as if they had been complicated toys or difficult books, took out of her hands and put away in the closet. ", "A wonderful assortment of objects of this kind she was to discover there later, all tumbled up too with the things, shuffled into the same receptacle, that her mother had said about her father. ", "She had the knowledge that on a certain occasion which every day brought nearer her mother would be at the door to take her away, and this would have darkened all the days if the ingenious Moddle hadn't written on a paper in very big easy words ever so many pleasures that she would enjoy at the other house. ", "These promises ranged from \"a mother's fond love\" to \"a nice poached egg to your tea,\" and took by the way the prospect of sitting up ever so late to see the lady in question dressed, in silks and velvets and diamonds and pearls, to go out: ", "so that it was a real support to Maisie, at the supreme hour, to feel how, by Moddle's direction, the paper was thrust away in her pocket and there clenched in her fist. ", "The supreme hour was to furnish her with a vivid reminiscence, that of a strange outbreak in the drawing-room on the part of Moddle, who, in reply to something her father had just said, cried aloud: ", "You ought to be perfectly ashamed of yourself-you ought to blush, sir, for the way you go on!\" ", "The carriage, with her mother in it, was at the door; ", "a gentleman who was there, who was always there, laughed out very loud; ", "her father, who had her in his arms, said to Moddle: ", "My dear woman, I'll settle you presently!\"-after which he repeated, showing his teeth more than ever at Maisie while he hugged her, the words for which her nurse had taken him up. ", "Maisie was not at the moment so fully conscious of them as of the wonder of Moddle's sudden disrespect and crimson face; ", "but she was able to produce them in the course of five minutes when, in the carriage, her mother, all kisses, ribbons, eyes, arms, strange sounds and sweet smells, said to her: ", "\"And did your beastly papa, my precious angel, send any message to your own loving mamma? ", "\" Then it was that she found the words spoken by her beastly papa to be, after all, in her little bewildered ears, from which, at her mother's appeal, they passed, in her clear shrill voice, straight to her little innocent lips. \" ", "He said I was to tell you, from him,\" she faithfully reported, \"that you're a nasty horrid pig!\" ", "II    ", "In that lively sense of the immediate which is the very air of a child's mind the past, on each occasion, became for her as indistinct as the future: ", "she surrendered herself to the actual with a good faith that might have been touching to either parent. ", "Crudely as they had calculated they were at first justified by the event: ", "she was the little feathered shuttlecock they could fiercely keep flying between them. ", "The evil they had the gift of thinking or pretending to think of each other they poured into her little gravely-gazing soul as into a boundless receptacle, and each of them had doubtless the best conscience in the world as to the duty of teaching her the stern truth that should be her safeguard against the other. ", "She was at the age for which all stories are true and all conceptions are stories. ", "The actual was the absolute, the present alone was vivid. ", "The objurgation for instance launched in the carriage by her mother after she had at her father's bidding punctually performed was a missive that dropped into her memory with the dry rattle of a letter falling into a pillar-box. ", "Like the letter it was, as part of the contents of a well-stuffed post-bag, delivered in due course at the right address. ", "In the presence of these overflowings, after they had continued for a couple of years, the associates of either party sometimes felt that something should be done for what they called \"the real good, don't you know? ", "\" of the child. ", "The only thing done, however, in general, took place when it was sighingly remarked that she fortunately wasn't all the year round where she happened to be at the awkward moment, and that, furthermore, either from extreme cunning or from extreme stupidity, she appeared not to take things in. ", "The theory of her stupidity, eventually embraced by her parents, corresponded with a great date in her small still life: ", "the complete vision, private but final, of the strange office she filled. ", "It was literally a moral revolution and accomplished in the depths of her nature. ", "The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms and legs; ", "old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened her. ", "She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; ", "on which a new remedy rose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of concealment. ", "She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious spirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult, and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so. ", "Her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed no longer. ", "She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and when, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she began to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen. ", "When therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before her that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real contraction of her little stream of life. ", "She spoiled their fun, but she practically added to her own. ", "She saw more and more; ", "she saw too much. ", "It was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion had sown the seeds of secrecy; ", "sown them not by anything she said, but by a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired. ", "Moddle had become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the child had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the alphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise something her nurse described as \"the important letter haitch.\" ", "Miss Overmore, however hungry, never disappeared: ", "this marked her somehow as of higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that Maisie supposed to be extraordinary. ", "Mrs. Farange had described her as almost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as Beale wasn't there. ", "Beale or no Beale,\" Maisie had heard her mother reply, \"I take her because she's a lady and yet awfully poor. ", "Rather nice people, but there are seven sisters at home. ", "What do people mean? ", "\" Maisie didn't know what people meant, but she knew very soon all the names of all the sisters; ", "she could say them off better than she could say the multiplication-table. ", "She privately wondered moreover, though she never asked, about the awful poverty, of which her companion also never spoke. ", "Food at any rate came up by mysterious laws; ", "Miss Overmore never, like Moddle, had on an apron, and when she ate she held her fork with her little finger curled out. ", "The child, who watched her at many moments, watched her particularly at that one. ", "\" I think you're lovely,\" she often said to her; ", "even mamma, who was lovely too, had not such a pretty way with the fork. ", "Maisie associated this showier presence with her now being \"big,\" knowing of course that nursery-governesses were only for little girls who were not, as she said, \"really\" little. ", "She vaguely knew, further, somehow, that the future was still bigger than she, and that a part of what made it so was the number of governesses lurking in it and ready to dart out. ", "Everything that had happened when she was really little was dormant, everything but the positive certitude, bequeathed from afar by Moddle, that the natural way for a child to have her parents was separate and successive, like her mutton and her pudding or her bath and her nap. \" ", "Does he know he lies?\"-that was what she had vivaciously asked Miss Overmore on the occasion which was so suddenly to lead to a change in her life. \" ", "Does he know-\" Miss Overmore stared; ", "she had a stocking pulled over her hand and was pricking at it with a needle which she poised in the act. ", "Her task was homely, but her movement, like all her movements, graceful. ", "\"Why papa.\" ", "\"That he 'lies'?\" ", "\"That's what mamma says I'm to tell him-'that he lies and he knows he lies.' ", "\" Miss Overmore turned very red, though she laughed out till her head fell back; ", "then she pricked again at her muffled hand so hard that Maisie wondered how she could bear it. \" ", "Am I to tell him? ", "the child went on. ", "It was then that her companion addressed her in the unmistakeable language of a pair of eyes of deep dark grey. ", "\" I can't say No,\" they replied as distinctly as possible; ", "\"I can't say No, because I'm afraid of your mamma, don't you see? ", "Yet how can I say Yes after your papa has been so kind to me, talking to me so long the other day, smiling and flashing his beautiful teeth at me the time we met him in the Park, the time when, rejoicing at the sight of us, he left the gentlemen he was with and turned and walked with us, stayed with us for half an hour?\" ", "Somehow in the light of Miss Overmore's lovely eyes that incident came back to Maisie with a charm it hadn't had at the time, and this in spite of the fact that after it was over her governess had never but once alluded to it. ", "On their way home, when papa had quitted them, she had expressed the hope that the child wouldn't mention it to mamma. ", "Maisie liked her so, and had so the charmed sense of being liked by her, that she accepted this remark as settling the matter and wonderingly conformed to it. ", "The wonder now lived again, lived in the recollection of what papa had said to Miss Overmore: ", "\"I've only to look at you to see you're a person I can appeal to for help to save my daughter. ", "\" Maisie's ignorance of what she was to be saved from didn't diminish the pleasure of the thought that Miss Overmore was saving her. ", "It seemed to make them cling together as in some wild game of \"going round.\" ", "III    ", "She was therefore all the more startled when her mother said to her in connexion with something to be done before her next migration: ", "\"You understand of course that she's not going with you. ", "\" Maisie turned quite faint. \" ", "Oh I thought she was.\" ", "\"It doesn't in the least matter, you know, what you think,\" Mrs. Farange loudly replied; ", "and you had better indeed for the future, miss, learn to keep your thoughts to yourself. ", "\" This was exactly what Maisie had already learned, and the accomplishment was just the source of her mother's irritation. ", "It was of a horrid little critical system, a tendency, in her silence, to judge her elders, that this lady suspected her, liking as she did, for her own part, a child to be simple and confiding. ", "She liked also to hear the report of the whacks she administered to Mr. Farange's character, to his pretensions to peace of mind: ", "the satisfaction of dealing them diminished when nothing came back. ", "The day was at hand, and she saw it, when she should feel more delight in hurling Maisie at him than in snatching her away; ", "so much so that her conscience winced under the acuteness of a candid friend who had remarked that the real end of all their tugging would be that each parent would try to make the little girl a burden to the other-a sort of game in which a fond mother clearly wouldn't show to advantage. ", "The prospect of not showing to advantage, a distinction in which she held she had never failed, begot in Ida Farange an ill humour of which several persons felt the effect. ", "She determined that Beale at any rate should feel it; ", "she reflected afresh that in the study of how to be odious to him she must never give way. ", "Nothing could incommode him more than not to get the good, for the child, of a nice female appendage who had clearly taken a fancy to her. ", "One of the things Ida said to the appendage was that Beale's was a house in which no decent woman could consent to be seen. ", "It was Miss Overmore herself who explained to Maisie that she had had a hope of being allowed to accompany her to her father's, and that this hope had been dashed by the way her mother took it. \" ", "She says that if I ever do such a thing as enter his service I must never expect to show my face in this house again. ", "So I've promised not to attempt to go with you. ", "If I wait patiently till you come back here we shall certainly be together once more.\" ", "Waiting patiently, and above all waiting till she should come back there, seemed to Maisie a long way round-it reminded her of all the things she had been told, first and last, that she should have if she'd be good and that in spite of her goodness she had never had at all. ", "Then who'll take care of me at papa's?\" ", "\"Heaven only knows, my own precious!\" ", "Miss Overmore replied, tenderly embracing her. ", "There was indeed no doubt that she was dear to this beautiful friend. ", "What could have proved it better than the fact that before a week was out, in spite of their distressing separation and her mother's prohibition and Miss Overmore's scruples and Miss Overmore's promise, the beautiful friend had turned up at her father's? ", "The little lady already engaged there to come by the hour, a fat dark little lady with a foreign name and dirty fingers, who wore, throughout, a bonnet that had at first given her a deceptive air, too soon dispelled, of not staying long, besides asking her pupil questions that had nothing to do with lessons, questions that Beale Farange himself, when two or three were repeated to him, admitted to be awfully low-this strange apparition faded before the bright creature who had braved everything for Maisie's sake. ", "The bright creature told her little charge frankly what had happened-that she had really been unable to hold out. ", "She had broken her vow to Mrs. Farange; ", "she had struggled for three days and then had come straight to Maisie's papa and told him the simple truth. ", "She adored his daughter; ", "she couldn't give her up; ", "she'd make for her any sacrifice. ", "On this basis it had been arranged that she should stay; ", "her courage had been rewarded; ", "she left Maisie in no doubt as to the amount of courage she had required. ", "Some of the things she said made a particular impression on the child-her declaration for instance that when her pupil should get older she'd understand better just how \"dreadfully bold\" a young lady, to do exactly what she had done, had to be. \" ", "Fortunately your papa appreciates it; ", "he appreciates it immensely\"-that was one of the things Miss Overmore also said, with a striking insistence on the adverb. ", "Maisie herself was no less impressed with what this martyr had gone through, especially after hearing of the terrible letter that had come from Mrs. Farange. ", "Mamma had been so angry that, in Miss Overmore's own words, she had loaded her with insult-proof enough indeed that they must never look forward to being together again under mamma's roof. ", "Mamma's roof, however, had its turn, this time, for the child, of appearing but remotely contingent, so that, to reassure her, there was scarce a need of her companion's secret, solemnly confided-the probability there would be no going back to mamma at all. ", "It was Miss Overmore's private conviction, and a part of the same communication, that if Mr. Farange's daughter would only show a really marked preference she would be backed up by \"public opinion\" in holding on to him. ", "Poor Maisie could scarcely grasp that incentive, but she could surrender herself to the day. ", "She had conceived her first passion, and the object of it was her governess. ", "It hadn't been put to her, and she couldn't, or at any rate she didn't, put it to herself, that she liked Miss Overmore better than she liked papa; ", "but it would have sustained her under such an imputation to feel herself able to reply that papa too liked Miss Overmore exactly as much. ", "He had particularly told her so. ", "Besides she could easily see it. ", "IV   All this led her on, but it brought on her fate as well, the day when her mother would be at the door in the carriage in which Maisie now rode on no occasions but these. ", "There was no question at present of Miss Overmore's going back with her: ", "it was universally recognised that her quarrel with Mrs. Farange was much too acute. ", "The child felt it from the first; ", "there was no hugging nor exclaiming as that lady drove her away-there was only a frightening silence, unenlivened even by the invidious enquiries of former years, which culminated, according to its stern nature, in a still more frightening old woman, a figure awaiting her on the very doorstep. ", "\" You're to be under this lady's care,\" said her mother. ", "\" Take her, Mrs. Wix,\" she added, addressing the figure impatiently and giving the child a push from which Maisie gathered that she wished to set Mrs. Wix an example of energy. ", "Mrs. Wix took her and, Maisie felt the next day, would never let her go. ", "She had struck her at first, just after Miss Overmore, as terrible; ", "but something in her voice at the end of an hour touched the little girl in a spot that had never even yet been reached. ", "Maisie knew later what it was, though doubtless she couldn't have made a statement of it: ", "these were things that a few days' talk with Mrs. Wix quite lighted up. ", "The principal one was a matter Mrs. Wix herself always immediately mentioned: ", "she had had a little girl quite of her own, and the little girl had been killed on the spot. ", "She had had absolutely nothing else in all the world, and her affliction had broken her heart. ", "It was comfortably established between them that Mrs. Wix's heart was broken. ", "What Maisie felt was that she had been, with passion and anguish, a mother, and that this was something Miss Overmore was not, something (strangely, confusingly) that mamma was even less. ", "So it was that in the course of an extraordinarily short time she found herself as deeply absorbed in the image of the little dead Clara Matilda, who, on a crossing in the Harrow Road, had been knocked down and crushed by the cruellest of hansoms, as she had ever found herself in the family group made vivid by one of seven. ", "She's your little dead sister,\" Mrs. Wix ended by saying, and Maisie, all in a tremor of curiosity and compassion, addressed from that moment a particular piety to the small accepted acquisition. ", "Somehow she wasn't a real sister, but that only made her the more romantic. ", "It contributed to this view of her that she was never to be spoken of in that character to any one else-least of all to Mrs. Farange, who wouldn't care for her nor recognise the relationship: ", "it was to be just an unutterable and inexhaustible little secret with Mrs. Wix. ", "Maisie knew everything about her that could be known, everything she had said or done in her little mutilated life, exactly how lovely she was, exactly how her hair was curled and her frocks were trimmed. ", "Her hair came down far below her waist-it was of the most wonderful golden brightness, just as Mrs. Wix's own had been a long time before. ", "Mrs. Wix's own was indeed very remarkable still, and Maisie had felt at first that she should never get on with it. ", "It played a large part in the sad and strange appearance, the appearance as of a kind of greasy greyness, which Mrs. Wix had presented on the child's arrival. ", "It had originally been yellow, but time had turned that elegance to ashes, to a turbid sallow unvenerable white. ", "Still excessively abundant, it was dressed in a manner of which the poor lady appeared not yet to have recognised the supersession, with a glossy braid, like a large diadem, on the top of the head, and behind, at the nape of the neck, a dingy rosette like a large button. ", "She wore glasses which, in humble reference to a divergent obliquity of vision, she called her straighteners, and a little ugly snuff-coloured dress trimmed with satin bands in the form of scallops and glazed with antiquity. ", "The straighteners, she explained to Maisie, were put on for the sake of others, whom, as she believed, they helped to recognise the bearing, otherwise doubtful, of her regard; ", "the rest of the melancholy garb could only have been put on for herself. ", "With the added suggestion of her goggles it reminded her pupil of the polished shell or corslet of a horrid beetle. ", "At first she had looked cross and almost cruel; ", "but this impression passed away with the child's increased perception of her being in the eyes of the world a figure mainly to laugh at. ", "She was as droll as a charade or an animal toward the end of the \"natural history\"-a person whom people, to make talk lively, described to each other and imitated. ", "Every one knew the straighteners; ", "every one knew the diadem and the button, the scallops and satin bands; ", "every one, though Maisie had never betrayed her, knew even Clara Matilda. ", "It was on account of these things that mamma got her for such low pay, really for nothing: ", "so much, one day when Mrs. Wix had accompanied her into the drawing-room and left her, the child heard one of the ladies she found there-a lady with eyebrows arched like skipping-ropes and thick black stitching, like ruled lines for musical notes on beautiful white gloves-announce to another. ", "She knew governesses were poor; ", "Miss Overmore was unmentionably and Mrs. Wix ever so publicly so. ", "Neither this, however, nor the old brown frock nor the diadem nor the button, made a difference for Maisie in the charm put forth through everything, the charm of Mrs. Wix's conveying that somehow, in her ugliness and her poverty, she was peculiarly and soothingly safe; ", "safer than any one in the world, than papa, than mamma, than the lady with the arched eyebrows; ", "safer even, though so much less beautiful, than Miss Overmore, on whose loveliness, as she supposed it, the little girl was faintly conscious that one couldn't rest with quite the same tucked-in and kissed-for-good-night feeling. ", "Mrs. Wix was as safe as Clara Matilda, who was in heaven and yet, embarrassingly, also in Kensal Green, where they had been together to see her little huddled grave. ", "It was from something in Mrs. Wix's tone, which in spite of caricature remained indescribable and inimitable, that Maisie, before her term with her mother was over, drew this sense of a support, like a breast-high banister in a place of \"drops,\" that would never give way. ", "If she knew her instructress was poor and queer she also knew she was not nearly so \"qualified\" as Miss Overmore, who could say lots of dates straight off (letting you hold the book yourself), state the position of Malabar, play six pieces without notes and, in a sketch, put in beautifully the trees and houses and difficult parts. ", "Maisie herself could play more pieces than Mrs. Wix, who was moreover visibly ashamed of her houses and trees and could only, with the help of a smutty forefinger, of doubtful legitimacy in the field of art, do the smoke coming out of the chimneys. ", "They dealt, the governess and her pupil, in \"subjects,\" but there were many the governess put off from week to week and that they never got to at all: ", "she only used to say \"We'll take that in its proper order. ", "Her order was a circle as vast as the untravelled globe. ", "She had not the spirit of adventure-the child could perfectly see how many subjects she was afraid of. ", "She took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, through which indeed there curled the blue river of truth. ", "She knew swarms of stories, mostly those of the novels she had read; ", "relating them with a memory that never faltered and a wealth of detail that was Maisie's delight. ", "They were all about love and beauty and countesses and wickedness. ", "Her conversation was practically an endless narrative, a great garden of romance, with sudden vistas into her own life and gushing fountains of homeliness. ", "These were the parts where they most lingered; ", "she made the child take with her again every step of her long, lame course and think it beyond magic or monsters. ", "Her pupil acquired a vivid vision of every one who had ever, in her phrase, knocked against her-some of them ", "oh so hard!-every one literally but Mr. Wix, her husband, as to whom nothing was mentioned save that he had been dead for ages. ", "He had been rather remarkably absent from his wife's career, and Maisie was never taken to see his grave. ", "V    ", "The second parting from Miss Overmore had been bad enough, but this first parting from Mrs. Wix was much worse. ", "The child had lately been to the dentist's and had a term of comparison for the screwed-up intensity of the scene. ", "It was dreadfully silent, as it had been when her tooth was taken out; ", "Mrs. Wix had on that occasion grabbed her hand and they had clung to each other with the frenzy of their determination not to scream. ", "Maisie, at the dentist's, had been heroically still, but just when she felt most anguish had become aware of an audible shriek on the part of her companion, a spasm of stifled sympathy. ", "This was reproduced by the only sound that broke their supreme embrace when, a month later, the \"arrangement,\" as her periodical uprootings were called, played the part of the horrible forceps. ", "Embedded in Mrs. Wix's nature as her tooth had been socketed in her gum, the operation of extracting her would really have been a case for chloroform. ", "It was a hug that fortunately left nothing to say, for the poor woman's want of words at such an hour seemed to fall in with her want of everything. ", "Maisie's alternate parent, in the outermost vestibule-he liked the impertinence of crossing as much as that of his late wife's threshold-stood over them with his open watch and his still more open grin, while from the only corner of an eye on which something of Mrs. Wix's didn't impinge the child saw at the door a brougham in which Miss Overmore also waited. ", "She remembered the difference when, six months before, she had been torn from the breast of that more spirited protectress. ", "Miss Overmore, then also in the vestibule, but of course in the other one, had been thoroughly audible and voluble; ", "her protest had rung out bravely and she had declared that something-her pupil didn't know exactly what-was a regular wicked shame. ", "That had at the time dimly recalled to Maisie the far-away moment of Moddle's great outbreak: ", "there seemed always to be \"shames\" connected in one way or another with her migrations. ", "At present, while Mrs. Wix's arms tightened and the smell of her hair was strong, she further remembered how, in pacifying Miss Overmore, papa had made use of the words \"you dear old duck!\"-an expression which, by its oddity, had stuck fast in her young mind, having moreover a place well prepared for it there by what she knew of the governess whom she now always mentally characterised as the pretty one. ", "She wondered whether this affection would be as great as before: ", "that would at all events be the case with the prettiness Maisie could see in the face which showed brightly at the window of the brougham. ", "The brougham was a token of harmony, of the fine conditions papa would this time offer: ", "he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a four-wheeler behind for the boxes. ", "The four-wheeler with the boxes on it was actually there, but mamma was the only lady with whom she had ever been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a private carriage. ", "Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, still more private, somehow, than mamma's; ", "and when at last she found herself quite on top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she put to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the continuity of a certain sentiment. \" ", "Did papa like you just the same while I was gone?\" ", "she enquired-full of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence. ", "She had bethought herself that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be only intermittent and for the season. ", "Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst into one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was, seemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and make her jump. ", "Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied: ", "Why, you little donkey, when you're away what have I left to do but just to love her?\" ", "Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had a merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria. ", "Then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely: ", "I shall make him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that to you I shall carry you straight off and we'll go and live somewhere together and be good quiet little girls. ", "\" The child couldn't quite make out why her father's speech had been horrid, since it only expressed that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as \"immense.\" ", "To enter more into the truth of the matter she appealed to him again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn't been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now. \" ", "Of course she has, old girl-where else could the poor dear be?\" cried Beale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who protested that unless he straightway \"took back\" his nasty wicked fib it would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too and his house and his tiresome trouble-all the impossible things he had succeeded in putting on her. ", "Beale, under this frolic menace, took nothing back at all; ", "he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating his extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that she was not to listen to his bad jokes: ", "she was to understand that a lady couldn't stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper reason. ", "Maisie looked from one of her companions to the other; ", "this was the freshest gayest start she had yet enjoyed, but she had a shy fear of not exactly believing them. \" ", "Well, what reason is proper? ", "she thoughtfully demanded. ", "\"Oh a long-legged stick of a tomboy: ", "there's none so good as that.\" ", "Her father enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get possession of her-an effort deprecated by their comrade and leading again to something of a public scuffle. ", "Miss Overmore declared to the child that she had been all the while with good friends; ", "on which Beale Farange went on: ", "She means good friends of mine, you know-tremendous friends of mine. ", "There has been no end of them about-that I will say for her!\" ", "Maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time conscious of a vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to the subject of so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been. ", "She didn't feel at all as if she had been seriously told, and no such feeling was supplied by anything that occurred later. ", "Her embarrassment, of a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that this was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used to say, to go into. ", "Therefore, under her father's roof during the time that followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an ingratiating way with housemaids; ", "and it was an odd truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by renewed contact with Miss Overmore. ", "The confidence looked for by that young lady was of the fine sort that explanation can't improve, and she herself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion. ", "For Maisie moreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception; ", "she had grown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that she was never to ask about them. ", "It was far from new to her that the questions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great: ", "except the affairs of her doll Lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at her mother's that was explicable with a grave face. ", "Nothing was so easy to her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks, and she might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more calculating turn. ", "Everything had something behind it: ", "life was like a long, long corridor with rows of closed doors. ", "She had learned that at these doors it was wise not to knock-this seemed to produce from within such sounds of derision. ", "Little by little, however, she understood more, for it befell that she was enlightened by Lisette's questions, which reproduced the effect of her own upon those for whom she sat in the very darkness of Lisette. ", "Was she not herself convulsed by such innocence? ", "In the presence of it she often imitated the shrieking ladies. ", "There were at any rate things she really couldn't tell even a French doll. ", "She could only pass on her lessons and study to produce on Lisette the impression of having mysteries in her life, wondering the while whether she succeeded in the air of shading off, like her mother, into the unknowable. ", "When the reign of Miss Overmore followed that of Mrs. Wix she took a fresh cue, emulating her governess and bridging over the interval with the simple expectation of trust. ", "Yes, there were matters one couldn't \"go into\" with a pupil. ", "There were for instance days when, after prolonged absence, Lisette, watching her take off her things, tried hard to discover where she had been. ", "Well, she discovered a little, but never discovered all. ", "There was an occasion when, on her being particularly indiscreet, Maisie replied to her-and precisely about the motive of a disappearance-as she, Maisie, had once been replied to by Mrs. Farange: ", "Find out for yourself!\" ", "She mimicked her mother's sharpness, but she was rather ashamed afterwards, though as to whether of the sharpness or of the mimicry was not quite clear. ", "VI    ", "She became aware in time that this phase wouldn't have shone by lessons, the care of her education being now only one of the many duties devolving on Miss Overmore; ", "a devolution as to which she was present at various passages between that lady and her father-passages significant, on either side, of dissent and even of displeasure. ", "It was gathered by the child on these occasions that there was something in the situation for which her mother might \"come down\" on them all, though indeed the remark, always dropped by her father, was greeted on his companion's part with direct contradiction. ", "Such scenes were usually brought to a climax by Miss Overmore's demanding, with more asperity than she applied to any other subject, in what position under the sun such a person as Mrs. Farange would find herself for coming down. ", "As the months went on the little girl's interpretations thickened, and the more effectually that this stretch was the longest she had known without a break. ", "She got used to the idea that her mother, for some reason, was in no hurry to reinstate her: ", "that idea was forcibly expressed by her father whenever Miss Overmore, differing and decided, took him up on the question, which he was always putting forward, of the urgency of sending her to school. ", "For a governess Miss Overmore differed surprisingly; ", "far more for instance than would have entered into the bowed head of Mrs. Wix. ", "She observed to Maisie many times that she was quite conscious of not doing her justice, and that Mr. Farange equally measured and equally lamented this deficiency. ", "The reason of it was that she had mysterious responsibilities that interfered-responsibilities, Miss Overmore intimated, to Mr. Farange himself and to the friendly noisy little house and those who came there. ", "Mr. Farange's remedy for every inconvenience was that the child should be put at school-there were such lots of splendid schools, as everybody knew, at Brighton and all over the place. ", "That, however, Maisie learned, was just what would bring her mother down: ", "from the moment he should delegate to others the housing of his little charge he hadn't a leg to stand on before the law. ", "Didn't he keep her away from her mother precisely because Mrs. Farange was one of these others? ", "There was also the solution of a second governess, a young person to come in by the day and really do the work; ", "but to this Miss Overmore wouldn't for a moment listen, arguing against it with great public relish and wanting to know from all comers-she put it even to Maisie herself-they didn't see how frightfully it would give her away. ", "\" What am I supposed to be at all, don't you see, if I'm not here to look after her?\" ", "She was in a false position and so freely and loudly called attention to it that it seemed to become almost a source of glory. ", "The way out of it of course was just to do her plain duty; ", "but that was unfortunately what, with his excessive, his exorbitant demands on her, which every one indeed appeared quite to understand, he practically, he selfishly prevented. ", "Beale Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never anything but \"he,\" and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom, under that designation, she chaffingly talked about him. ", "Maisie meanwhile, as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done with her, was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful thought of the large loose discipline of Mrs. Wix; ", "yet she none the less held it under her father's roof a point of superiority that none of his visitors were ladies. ", "It added to this odd security that she had once heard a gentleman say to him as if it were a great joke and in obvious reference to Miss Overmore: ", "Hanged if she'll let another woman come near you-hanged if she ever will. ", "She'd let fly a stick at her as they do at a strange cat!\" ", "Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates in spite of their also having their way-louder but sooner over-of laughing out at her. ", "They pulled and pinched, they teased and tickled her; ", "some of them even, as they termed it, shied things at her, and all of them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to her own. ", "The ladies on the other hand addressed her as \"You poor pet\" and scarcely touched her even to kiss her. ", "But it was of the ladies she was most afraid. ", "She was now old enough to understand how disproportionate a stay she had already made with her father; ", "and also old enough to enter a little into the ambiguity attending this excess, which oppressed her particularly whenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess. ", "\" Oh you needn't worry: ", "she doesn't care!\" ", "Miss Overmore had often said to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her prolonged detention. ", "\" She has other people than poor little you to think about, and has gone abroad with them; ", "so you needn't be in the least afraid she'll stickle this time for her rights. ", "\" Maisie knew Mrs. Farange had gone abroad, for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter from her beginning \"My precious pet\" and taking leave of her for an indeterminate time; ", "but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred or of the writer's policy of asserting herself, for the sharpest of all her impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever care so much about as to torment Mr. Farange. ", "What at last, however, was in this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a suspicion that a better way had been found to torment Mr. Farange than to deprive him of his periodical burden. ", "This was the question that worried our young lady and that Miss Overmore's confidences and the frequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying. ", "It was a contradiction that if Ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights she had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldn't jump at the monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely fought; ", "but when Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, sounded this new ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly abused. ", "Miss Overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent reserve, but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness not inferior to Beale's own on the subject of the lady who had fled to the Continent to wriggle out of her job. ", "It would serve this lady right, Maisie gathered, if that contract, in the shape of an overgrown and underdressed daughter, should be shipped straight out to her and landed at her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses. ", "The picture of these pursuits was what Miss Overmore took refuge in when the child tried timidly to ascertain if her father were disposed to feel he had too much of her. ", "She evaded the point and only kicked up all round it the dust of Ida's heartlessness and folly, of which the supreme proof, it appeared, was the fact that she was accompanied on her journey by a gentleman whom, to be painfully plain on it, she had-well, \"picked up.\" ", "The terms on which, unless they were married, ladies and gentlemen might, as Miss Overmore expressed it, knock about together, were the terms on which she and Mr. Farange had exposed themselves to possible misconception. ", "She had indeed, as has been noted, often explained this before, often said to Maisie: ", "I don't know what in the world, darling, your father and I should do without you, for you just make the difference, as I've told you, of keeping us perfectly proper. ", "The child took in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she performed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the event of her mother's giving her up. ", "Familiar as she had grown with the fact of the great alternative to the proper, she felt in her governess and her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment. ", "At the same time she had heard somehow of little girls-of exalted rank, it was true-whose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex, and she knew that if she were at school at Brighton it would be thought an advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters. ", "She turned these things over and remarked to Miss Overmore that if she should go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor. ", "\"The gentleman? ", "The proposition was complicated enough to make Miss Overmore stare. ", "The one who's with mamma. ", "Mightn't that make it right-as right as your being my governess makes it for you to be with papa?\" ", "Miss Overmore considered; ", "she coloured a little; ", "then she embraced her ingenious friend. ", "\" You're too sweet! ", "I'm a real governess.\" ", "\"And couldn't he be a real tutor?\" ", "\"Of course not. ", "He's ignorant and bad.\" ", "\"Bad-?\" ", "Maisie echoed with wonder. ", "Her companion gave a queer little laugh at her tone. ", "\" He's ever so much younger-\" But that was all. \" ", "Younger than you?\" ", "Miss Overmore laughed again; ", "it was the first time Maisie had seen her approach so nearly to a giggle. \" ", "Younger than-no matter whom. ", "I don't know anything about him and don't want to,\" she rather inconsequently added. ", "\" He's not my sort, and I'm sure, my own darling, he's not yours.\" ", "And she repeated the free caress into which her colloquies with Maisie almost always broke and which made the child feel that her affection at least was a gage of safety. ", "Parents had come to seem vague, but governesses were evidently to be trusted. ", "Maisie's faith in Mrs. Wix for instance had suffered no lapse from the fact that all communication with her had temporarily dropped. ", "During the first weeks of their separation Clara Matilda's mamma had repeatedly and dolefully written to her, and Maisie had answered with an enthusiasm controlled only by orthographical doubts; ", "but the correspondence had been duly submitted to Miss Overmore, with the final effect of its not suiting her. ", "It was this lady's view that Mr. Farange wouldn't care for it at all, and she ended by confessing-since her pupil pushed her-that she didn't care for it herself. ", "She was furiously jealous, she said; ", "and that weakness was but a new proof of her disinterested affection. ", "She pronounced Mrs. Wix's effusions moreover illiterate and unprofitable; ", "she made no scruple of declaring it monstrous that a woman in her senses should have placed the formation of her daughter's mind in such ridiculous hands. ", "Maisie was well aware that the proprietress of the old brown dress and the old odd headgear was lower in the scale of \"form\" than Miss Overmore; ", "but it was now brought home to her with pain that she was educationally quite out of the question. ", "She was buried for the time beneath a conclusive remark of her critic's: ", "She's really beyond a joke!\" ", "This remark was made as that charming woman held in her hand the last letter that Maisie was to receive from Mrs. Wix; ", "it was fortified by a decree proscribing the preposterous tie. \" ", "Must I then write and tell her?\" ", "the child bewilderedly asked: ", "she grew pale at the dreadful things it appeared involved for her to say. ", "\" Don't dream of it, my dear-I'll write: ", "you may trust me!\" cried Miss Overmore; ", "who indeed wrote to such purpose that a hush in which you could have heard a pin drop descended upon poor Mrs. Wix. ", "She gave for weeks and weeks no sign whatever of life: ", "it was as if she had been as effectually disposed of by Miss Overmore's communication as her little girl, in the Harrow Road, had been disposed of by the terrible hansom. ", "Her very silence became after this one of the largest elements of Maisie's consciousness; ", "it proved a warm and habitable air, into which the child penetrated further than she dared ever to mention to her companions. ", "Somewhere in the depths of it the dim straighteners were fixed upon her; ", "somewhere out of the troubled little current Mrs. Wix intensely waited. ", "VII    ", "It quite fell in with this intensity that one day, on returning from a walk with the housemaid, Maisie should have found her in the hall, seated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraph-boys who haunted Beale Farange's door and kicked their heels while, in his room, answers to their missives took form with the aid of smoke-puffs and growls. ", "It had seemed to her on their parting that Mrs. Wix had reached the last limits of the squeeze, but she now felt those limits to be transcended and that the duration of her visitor's hug was a direct reply to Miss Overmore's veto. ", "She understood in a flash how the visit had come to be possible-that Mrs. Wix, watching her chance, must have slipped in under protection of the fact that papa, always tormented in spite of arguments with the idea of a school, had, for a three days' excursion to Brighton, absolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary. ", "It was true that when Maisie explained their absence and their important motive Mrs. Wix wore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in surprise. ", "This contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish, for at the very moment that, in the spirit of it, she threw herself afresh upon her young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the door and Miss Overmore bounded out. ", "The shock of her encounter with Mrs. Wix was less violent than Maisie had feared on seeing her and didn't at all interfere with the sociable tone in which, under her rival's eyes, she explained to her little charge that she had returned, for a particular reason, a day sooner than she first intended. ", "She had left papa-in such nice lodgings-at Brighton; ", "but he would come back to his dear little home on the morrow. ", "As for Mrs. Wix, papa's companion supplied Maisie in later converse with the right word for the attitude of this personage: ", "Mrs. Wix \"stood up\" to her in a manner that the child herself felt at the time to be astonishing. ", "This occurred indeed after Miss Overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the dining-room, where, in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down, it was scarcely more than natural that even poor Mrs. Wix should stand up. ", "Maisie at once enquired if at Brighton, this time, anything had come of the possibility of a school; ", "to which, much to her surprise, Miss Overmore, who had always grandly repudiated it, replied after an instant, but quite as if Mrs. Wix were not there: ", "\"It may be, darling, that something will come. ", "The objection, I must tell you, has been quite removed. ", "At this it was still more startling to hear Mrs. Wix speak out with great firmness. ", "\" I don't think, if you'll allow me to say so, that there's any arrangement by which the objection can be 'removed.' ", "What has brought me here to-day is that I've a message for Maisie from dear Mrs. Farange. ", "\" The child's heart gave a great thump. ", "\" Oh mamma's come back?\" ", "\"Not yet, sweet love, but she's coming,\" said Mrs. Wix, \"and she has-most thoughtfully, you know-sent me on to prepare you.\" ", "\"To prepare her for what, pray?\" asked Miss Overmore, whose first smoothness began, with this news, to be ruffled. ", "Mrs. Wix quietly applied her straighteners to Miss Overmore's flushed beauty. \" ", "Well, miss, for a very important communication.\" ", "\"Can't dear Mrs. Farange, as you so oddly call her, make her communications directly? ", "Can't she take the trouble to write to her only daughter?\" ", "the younger lady demanded. ", "\" Maisie herself will tell you that it's months and months since she has had so much as a word from her.\" ", "\"Oh but I've written to mamma!\" cried the child as if this would do quite as well. ", "\"That makes her treatment of you all the greater scandal,\" the governess in possession promptly declared. \" ", "Mrs. Farange is too well aware,\" said Mrs. Wix with sustained spirit, \"of what becomes of her letters in this house. ", "\" Maisie's sense of fairness hereupon interposed for her visitor. ", "\" You know, Miss Overmore, that papa doesn't like everything of mamma's.\" ", "\"No one likes, my dear, to be made the subject of such language as your mother's letters contain. ", "They were not fit for the innocent child to see,\" Miss Overmore observed to Mrs. Wix. ", "\"Then I don't know what you complain of, and she's better without them. ", "It serves every purpose that I'm in Mrs. Farange's confidence.\" ", "Miss Overmore gave a scornful laugh. ", "\" Then you must be mixed up with some extraordinary proceedings!\" ", "\"None so extraordinary,\" cried Mrs. Wix, turning very pale, \"as to say horrible things about the mother to the face of the helpless daughter!\" ", "\"Things not a bit more horrible, I think,\" Miss Overmore returned, \"than those you, madam, appear to have come here to say about the father!\" ", "Mrs. Wix looked for a moment hard at Maisie, and then, turning again to this witness, spoke with a trembling voice. ", "\" I came to say nothing about him, and you must excuse Mrs. Farange and me if we're not so above all reproach as the companion of his travels. ", "\" The young woman thus described stared at the apparent breadth of the description-she needed a moment to take it in. ", "Maisie, however, gazing solemnly from one of the disputants to the other, noted that her answer, when it came, perched upon smiling lips. ", "\" It will do quite as well, no doubt, if you come up to the requirements of the companion of Mrs. Farange's!\" ", "Mrs. Wix broke into a queer laugh; ", "it sounded to Maisie an unsuccessful imitation of a neigh. ", "\" That's just what I'm here to make known-how perfectly the poor lady comes up to them herself.\" ", "She held up her head at the child. ", "\" You must take your mamma's message, Maisie, and you must feel that her wishing me to come to you with it this way is a great proof of interest and affection. ", "She sends you her particular love and announces to you that she's engaged to be married to Sir Claude.\" ", "\"Sir Claude? ", "Maisie wonderingly echoed. ", "But while Mrs. Wix explained that this gentleman was a dear friend of Mrs. Farange's, who had been of great assistance to her in getting to Florence and in making herself comfortable there for the winter, she was not too violently shaken to perceive her old friend's enjoyment of the effect of this news on Miss Overmore. ", "That young lady opened her eyes very wide; ", "she immediately remarked that Mrs. Farange's marriage would of course put an end to any further pretension to take her daughter back. ", "Mrs. Wix enquired with astonishment why it should do anything of the sort, and Miss Overmore gave as an instant reason that it was clearly but another dodge in a system of dodges. ", "She wanted to get out of the bargain: ", "why else had she now left Maisie on her father's hands weeks and weeks beyond the time about which she had originally made such a fuss? ", "It was vain for Mrs. Wix to represent-as she speciously proceeded to do-that all this time would be made up as soon as Mrs. Farange returned: ", "she, Miss Overmore, knew nothing, thank heaven, about her confederate, but was very sure any person capable of forming that sort of relation with the lady in Florence would easily agree to object to the presence in his house of the fruit of a union that his dignity must ignore. ", "It was a game like another, and Mrs. Wix's visit was clearly the first move in it. ", "Maisie found in this exchange of asperities a fresh incitement to the unformulated fatalism in which her sense of her own career had long since taken refuge; ", "and it was the beginning for her of a deeper prevision that, in spite of Miss Overmore's brilliancy and Mrs. Wix's passion, she should live to see a change in the nature of the struggle she appeared to have come into the world to produce. ", "It would still be essentially a struggle, but its object would now be not to receive her. ", "Mrs. Wix, after Miss Overmore's last demonstration, addressed herself wholly to the little girl, and, drawing from the pocket of her dingy old pelisse a small flat parcel, removed its envelope and wished to know if that looked like a gentleman who wouldn't be nice to everybody-let alone to a person he would be so sure to find so nice. ", "Mrs. Farange, in the candour of new-found happiness, had enclosed a \"cabinet\" photograph of Sir Claude, and Maisie lost herself in admiration of the fair smooth face, the regular features, the kind eyes, the amiable air, the general glossiness and smartness of her prospective stepfather-only vaguely puzzled to suppose herself now with two fathers at once. ", "Her researches had hitherto indicated that to incur a second parent of the same sex you had usually to lose the first. \" ", "Isn't he sympathetic?\" asked Mrs. Wix, who had clearly, on the strength of his charming portrait, made up her mind that Sir Claude promised her a future. ", "\" You can see, I hope,\" she added with much expression, \"that he's a perfect gentleman!\" ", "Maisie had never before heard the word \"sympathetic\" applied to anybody's face; ", "she heard it with pleasure and from that moment it agreeably remained with her. ", "She testified moreover to the force of her own perception in a small soft sigh of response to the pleasant eyes that seemed to seek her acquaintance, to speak to her directly. ", "He's quite lovely!\" ", "she declared to Mrs. Wix. ", "Then eagerly, irrepressibly, as she still held the photograph and Sir Claude continued to fraternise, \"Oh can't I keep it? ", "she broke out. ", "No sooner had she done so than she looked up from it at Miss Overmore: ", "this was with the sudden instinct of appealing to the authority that had long ago impressed on her that she mustn't ask for things. ", "Miss Overmore, to her surprise, looked distant and rather odd, hesitating and giving her time to turn again to Mrs. Wix. ", "Then Maisie saw that lady's long face lengthen; ", "it was stricken and almost scared, as if her young friend really expected more of her than she had to give. ", "The photograph was a possession that, direly denuded, she clung to, and there was a momentary struggle between her fond clutch of it and her capability of every sacrifice for her precarious pupil. ", "With the acuteness of her years, however, Maisie saw that her own avidity would triumph, and she held out the picture to Miss Overmore as if she were quite proud of her mother. ", "Isn't he just lovely?\" ", "she demanded while poor Mrs. Wix hungrily wavered, her straighteners largely covering it and her pelisse gathered about her with an intensity that strained its ancient seams. ", "\"It was to me, darling,\" the visitor said, \"that your mamma so generously sent it; ", "but of course if it would give you particular pleasure-\" she faltered, only gasping her surrender. ", "Miss Overmore continued extremely remote. ", "\" If the photograph's your property, my dear, I shall be happy to oblige you by looking at it on some future occasion. ", "But you must excuse me if I decline to touch an object belonging to Mrs. Wix. ", "\" That lady had by this time grown very red. ", "\" You might as well see him this way, miss,\" she retorted, \"as you certainly never will, I believe, in any other! ", "Keep the pretty picture, by all means, my precious,\" she went on: ", "Sir Claude will be happy himself, I dare say, to give me one with a kind inscription. ", "The pathetic quaver of this brave boast was not lost on Maisie, who threw herself so gratefully on the speaker's neck that, when they had concluded their embrace, the public tenderness of which, she felt, made up for the sacrifice she imposed, their companion had had time to lay a quick hand on Sir Claude and, with a glance at him or not, whisk him effectually out of sight. ", "Released from the child's arms Mrs. Wix looked about for the picture; ", "then she fixed Miss Overmore with a hard dumb stare; ", "and finally, with her eyes on the little girl again, achieved the grimmest of smiles. ", "\" Well, nothing matters, Maisie, because there's another thing your mamma wrote about. ", "She has made sure of me. ", "\" Even after her loyal hug Maisie felt a bit of a sneak as she glanced at Miss Overmore for permission to understand this. ", "But Mrs. Wix left them in no doubt of what it meant. ", "\" She has definitely engaged me-for her return and for yours. ", "Then you'll see for yourself. ", "Maisie, on the spot, quite believed she should; ", "but the prospect was suddenly thrown into confusion by an extraordinary demonstration from Miss Overmore. \" ", "Mrs. Wix,\" said that young lady, \"has some undiscoverable reason for regarding your mother's hold on you as strengthened by the fact that she's about to marry. ", "I wonder then-on that system-what our visitor will say to your father's.\" ", "Miss Overmore's words were directed to her pupil, but her face, lighted with an irony that made it prettier even than ever before, was presented to the dingy figure that had stiffened itself for departure. ", "The child's discipline had been bewildering-had ranged freely between the prescription that she was to answer when spoken to and the experience of lively penalties on obeying that prescription. ", "This time, nevertheless, she felt emboldened for risks; ", "above all as something portentous seemed to have leaped into her sense of the relations of things. ", "She looked at Miss Overmore much as she had a way of looking at persons who treated her to \"grown up\" jokes. \" ", "Do you mean papa's hold on me-do you mean he's about to marry?\" ", "\"Papa's not about to marry-papa is married, my dear. ", "Papa was married the day before yesterday at Brighton.\" ", "Miss Overmore glittered more gaily; ", "meanwhile it came over Maisie, and quite dazzlingly, that her \"smart\" governess was a bride. \" ", "He's my husband, if you please, and I'm his little wife. ", "So now we'll see who's your little mother!\" ", "She caught her pupil to her bosom in a manner that was not to be outdone by the emissary of her predecessor, and a few moments later, when things had lurched back into their places, that poor lady, quite defeated of the last word, had soundlessly taken flight. ", "VIII   After Mrs. Wix's retreat Miss Overmore appeared to recognise that she was not exactly in a position to denounce Ida Farange's second union; ", "but she drew from a table-drawer the photograph of Sir Claude and, standing there before Maisie, studied it at some length. \" ", "Isn't he beautiful? ", "\" the child ingenuously asked. ", "Her companion hesitated. ", "\" No-he's horrid,\" she, to Maisie's surprise, sharply returned. ", "But she debated another minute, after which she handed back the picture. ", "It appeared to Maisie herself to exhibit a fresh attraction, and she was troubled, having never before had occasion to differ from her lovely friend. ", "So she only could ask what, such being the case, she should do with it: ", "should she put it quite away-where it wouldn't be there to offend? ", "On this Miss Overmore again cast about; ", "after which she said unexpectedly: ", "\"Put it on the schoolroom mantelpiece. ", "\" Maisie felt a fear. \" ", "Won't papa dislike to see it there?\" ", "\"Very much indeed; ", "but that won't matter now.\" ", "Miss Overmore spoke with peculiar significance and to her pupil's mystification. ", "On account of the marriage? ", "\" Maisie risked. ", "Miss Overmore laughed, and Maisie could see that in spite of the irritation produced by Mrs. Wix she was in high spirits. ", "\" Which marriage do you mean?\" ", "With the question put to her it suddenly struck the child she didn't know, so that she felt she looked foolish. ", "So she took refuge in saying: ", "Shall you be different-\" This was a full implication that the bride of Sir Claude would be. ", "As your father's wedded wife? ", "Utterly!\" ", "Miss Overmore replied. ", "And the difference began of course in her being addressed, even by Maisie, from that day and by her particular request, as Mrs. Beale. ", "It was there indeed principally that it ended, for except that the child could reflect that she should presently have four parents in all, and also that at the end of three months the staircase, for a little girl hanging over banisters, sent up the deepening rustle of more elaborate advances, everything made the same impression as before. ", "Mrs. Beale had very pretty frocks, but Miss Overmore's had been quite as good, and if papa was much fonder of his second wife than he had been of his first Maisie had foreseen that fondness, had followed its development almost as closely as the person more directly involved. ", "There was little indeed in the commerce of her companions that her precocious experience couldn't explain, for if they struck her as after all rather deficient in that air of the honeymoon of which she had so often heard-in much detail, for instance, from Mrs. Wix-it was natural to judge the circumstance in the light of papa's proved disposition to contest the empire of the matrimonial tie. ", "His honeymoon, when he came back from Brighton-not on the morrow of Mrs. Wix's visit, and not, oddly, till several days later-his honeymoon was perhaps perceptibly tinged with the dawn of a later stage of wedlock. ", "There were things dislike of which, as the child knew it, wouldn't matter to Mrs. Beale now, and their number increased so that such a trifle as his hostility to the photograph of Sir Claude quite dropped out of view. ", "This pleasing object found a conspicuous place in the schoolroom, which in truth Mr. Farange seldom entered and in which silent admiration formed, during the time I speak of, almost the sole scholastic exercise of Mrs. Beale's pupil. ", "Maisie was not long in seeing just what her stepmother had meant by the difference she should show in her new character. ", "If she was her father's wife she was not her own governess, and if her presence had had formerly to be made regular by the theory of a humble function she was now on a footing that dispensed with all theories and was inconsistent with all servitude. ", "That was what she had meant by the drop of the objection to a school; ", "her small companion was no longer required at home as-it was Mrs. Beale's own amusing word-a little duenna. ", "The argument against a successor to Miss Overmore remained: ", "it was composed frankly of the fact, of which Mrs. Beale granted the full absurdity, that she was too awfully fond of her stepdaughter to bring herself to see her in vulgar and mercenary hands. ", "The note of this particular danger emboldened Maisie to put in a word for Mrs. Wix, the modest measure of whose avidity she had taken from the first; ", "but Mrs. Beale disposed afresh and effectually of a candidate who would be sure to act in some horrible and insidious way for Ida's interest and who moreover was personally loathsome and as ignorant as a fish. ", "She made also no more of a secret of the awkward fact that a good school would be hideously expensive, and of the further circumstance, which seemed to put an end to everything, that when it came to the point papa, in spite of his previous clamour, was really most nasty about paying. \" ", "Would you believe,\" Mrs. Beale confidentially asked of her little charge, \"that he says I'm a worse expense than ever, and that a daughter and a wife together are really more than he can afford? ", "\" It was thus that the splendid school at Brighton lost itself in the haze of larger questions, though the fear that it would provoke Ida to leap into the breach subsided with her prolonged, her quite shameless non-appearance. ", "Her daughter and her successor were therefore left to gaze in united but helpless blankness at all Maisie was not learning. ", "This quantity was so great as to fill the child's days with a sense of intermission to which even French Lisette gave no accent-with finished games and unanswered questions and dreaded tests; ", "with the habit, above all, in her watch for a change, of hanging over banisters when the door-bell sounded. ", "This was the great refuge of her impatience, but what she heard at such times was a clatter of gaiety downstairs; ", "the impression of which, from her earliest childhood, had built up in her the belief that the grown-up time was the time of real amusement and above all of real intimacy. ", "Even Lisette, even Mrs. Wix had never, she felt, in spite of hugs and tears, been so intimate with her as so many persons at present were with Mrs. Beale and as so many others of old had been with Mrs. Farange. ", "The note of hilarity brought people together still more than the note of melancholy, which was the one exclusively sounded, for instance, by poor Mrs. Wix. ", "Maisie in these days preferred none the less that domestic revels should be wafted to her from a distance: ", "she felt sadly unsupported for facing the inquisition of the drawing-room. ", "That was a reason the more for making the most of Susan Ash, who in her quality of under-housemaid moved at a very different level and who, none the less, was much depended upon out of doors. ", "She was a guide to peregrinations that had little in common with those intensely definite airings that had left with the child a vivid memory of the regulated mind of Moddle. ", "There had been under Moddle's system no dawdles at shop-windows and no nudges, in Oxford Street, of \"I say, look at 'er!\" ", "There had been an inexorable treatment of crossings and a serene exemption from the fear that-especially at corners, of which she was yet weakly fond-haunted the housemaid, the fear of being, as she ominously said, \"spoken to.\" ", "The dangers of the town equally with its diversions added to Maisie's sense of being untutored and unclaimed. ", "The situation however, had taken a twist when, on another of her returns, at Susan's side, extremely tired, from the pursuit of exercise qualified by much hovering, she encountered another emotion. ", "She on this occasion learnt at the door that her instant attendance was requested in the drawing-room. ", "Crossing the threshold in a cloud of shame she discerned through the blur Mrs. Beale seated there with a gentleman who immediately drew the pain from her predicament by rising before her as the original of the photograph of Sir Claude. ", "She felt the moment she looked at him that he was by far the most shining presence that had ever made her gape, and her pleasure in seeing him, in knowing that he took hold of her and kissed her, as quickly throbbed into a strange shy pride in him, a perception of his making up for her fallen state, for Susan's public nudges, which quite bruised her, and for all the lessons that, in the dead schoolroom, where at times she was almost afraid to stay alone, she was bored with not having. ", "It was as if he had told her on the spot that he belonged to her, so that she could already show him off and see the effect he produced. ", "No, nothing else that was most beautiful ever belonging to her could kindle that particular joy-not Mrs. Beale at that very moment, not papa when he was gay, nor mamma when she was dressed, nor Lisette when she was new. ", "The joy almost overflowed in tears when he laid his hand on her and drew her to him, telling her, with a smile of which the promise was as bright as that of a Christmas-tree, that he knew her ever so well by her mother, but had come to see her now so that he might know her for himself. ", "She could see that his view of this kind of knowledge was to make her come away with him, and, further, that it was just what he was there for and had already been some time: ", "arranging it with Mrs. Beale and getting on with that lady in a manner evidently not at all affected by her having on the arrival of his portrait thought of him so ill. ", "They had grown almost intimate-or had the air of it-over their discussion; ", "and it was still further conveyed to Maisie that Mrs. Beale had made no secret, and would make yet less of one, of all that it cost to let her go. ", "\" You seem so tremendously eager,\" she said to the child, \"that I hope you're at least clear about Sir Claude's relation to you. ", "It doesn't appear to occur to him to give you the necessary reassurance. ", "\" Maisie, a trifle mystified, turned quickly to her new friend. ", "\" Why it's of course that you're married to her, isn't it?\" ", "Her anxious emphasis started them off, as she had learned to call it; ", "this was the echo she infallibly and now quite resignedly produced; ", "moreover Sir Claude's laughter was an indistinguishable part of the sweetness of his being there. ", "\" We've been married, my dear child, three months, and my interest in you is a consequence, don't you know? ", "of my great affection for your mother. ", "In coming here it's of course for your mother I'm acting.\" ", "\"Oh I know,\" Maisie said with all the candour of her competence. ", "\" She can't come herself-except just to the door.\" ", "Then as she thought afresh: ", "Can't she come even to the door now?\" ", "\"There you are!\" ", "Mrs. Beale exclaimed to Sir Claude. ", "She spoke as if his dilemma were ludicrous. ", "His kind face, in a hesitation, seemed to recognise it; ", "but he answered the child with a frank smile. ", "No-not very well.\" ", "\"Because she has married you?\" ", "He promptly accepted this reason. ", "\" Well, that has a good deal to do with it.\" ", "He was so delightful to talk to that Maisie pursued the subject. \" ", "But papa-he has married Miss Overmore.\" ", "\"Ah you'll see that he won't come for you at your mother's,\" that lady interposed. ", "Yes, but that won't be for a long time,\" Maisie hastened to respond. ", "\"We won't talk about it now-you've months and months to put in first.\" ", "And Sir Claude drew her closer. ", "\"Oh that's what makes it so hard to give her up!\" ", "Mrs. Beale made this point with her arms out to her stepdaughter. ", "Maisie, quitting Sir Claude, went over to them and, clasped in a still tenderer embrace, felt entrancingly the extension of the field of happiness. ", "\" I'll come for you,\" said her stepmother, \"if Sir Claude keeps you too long: ", "we must make him quite understand that! ", "Don't talk to me about her ladyship! ", "she went on to their visitor so familiarly that it was almost as if they must have met before. ", "\" I know her ladyship as if I had made her. ", "They're a pretty pair of parents!\" cried Mrs. Beale. ", "Maisie had so often heard them called so that the remark diverted her but an instant from the agreeable wonder of this grand new form of allusion to her mother; ", "and that, in its turn, presently left her free to catch at the pleasant possibility, in connexion with herself, of a relation much happier as between Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude than as between mamma and papa. ", "Still the next thing that happened was that her interest in such a relation brought to her lips a fresh question. \" ", "Have you seen papa?\" ", "she asked of Sir Claude. ", "It was the signal for their going off again, as her small stoicism had perfectly taken for granted that it would be. ", "All that Mrs. Beale had nevertheless to add was the vague apparent sarcasm: ", "\"Oh papa!\" ", "\"I'm assured he's not at home,\" Sir Claude replied to the child; ", "but if he had been I should have hoped for the pleasure of seeing him.\" ", "\"Won't he mind your coming? ", "Maisie asked as with need of the knowledge. ", "\"Oh you bad little girl!\" ", "Mrs. Beale humorously protested. ", "The child could see that at this Sir Claude, though still moved to mirth, coloured a little; ", "but he spoke to her very kindly. ", "\" That's just what I came to see, you know-whether your father would mind. ", "But Mrs. Beale appears strongly of the opinion that he won't.\" ", "This lady promptly justified that view to her stepdaughter. ", "\" It will be very interesting, my dear, you know, to find out what it is to-day that your father does mind. ", "I'm sure I don't know!\"-and she seemed to repeat, though with perceptible resignation, her plaint of a moment before. ", "\" Your father, darling, is a very odd person indeed.\" ", "She turned with this, smiling, to Sir Claude. ", "\" But perhaps it's hardly civil for me to say that of his not objecting to have you in the house. ", "If you knew some of the people he does have! ", "Maisie knew them all, and none indeed were to be compared to Sir Claude. ", "He laughed back at Mrs. Beale; ", "he looked at such moments quite as Mrs. Wix, in the long stories she told her pupil, always described the lovers of her distressed beauties-\"the perfect gentleman and strikingly handsome.\" ", "He got up, to the child's regret, as if he were going. ", "\" Oh I dare say we should be all right!\" ", "Mrs. Beale once more gathered in her little charge, holding her close and looking thoughtfully over her head at their visitor. ", "\" It's so charming-for a man of your type-to have wanted her so much!\" ", "\"What do you know about my type?\" ", "Sir Claude laughed. ", "\" Whatever it may be I dare say it deceives you. ", "The truth about me is simply that I'm the most unappreciated of-what do you call the fellows?-'family-men.' ", "Yes, I'm a family-man; ", "upon my honour I am!\" ", "\"Then why on earth,\" cried Mrs. Beale, \"didn't you marry a family-woman?\" ", "Sir Claude looked at her hard. ", "\" You know who one marries, I think. ", "Besides, there are no family-women-hanged if there are! ", "None of them want any children-hanged if they do!\" ", "His account of the matter was most interesting, and Maisie, as if it were of bad omen for her, stared at the picture in some dismay. ", "At the same time she felt, through encircling arms, her protectress hesitate. ", "\" You do come out with things! ", "But you mean her ladyship doesn't want any-really?\" ", "\"Won't hear of them-simply. ", "But she can't help the one she has got.\" ", "And with this Sir Claude's eyes rested on the little girl in a way that seemed to her to mask her mother's attitude with the consciousness of his own. ", "\" She must make the best of her, don't you see? ", "If only for the look of the thing, don't you know? ", "one wants one's wife to take the proper line about her child.\" ", "\"Oh I know what one wants!\" ", "Mrs. Beale cried with a competence that evidently impressed her interlocutor. \" ", "Well, if you keep him up-and I dare say you've had worry enough-why shouldn't I keep Ida? ", "What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander-or the other way round, don't you know? ", "I mean to see the thing through.\" ", "Mrs. Beale, for a minute, still with her eyes on him as he leaned upon the chimneypiece, appeared to turn this over.

", "\"What do you call 'nice'?\" ", "\"Well, they're all right.\" ", "\"That doesn't answer me,\" said Mrs. Beale; ", "but I dare say you do take care of them. ", "That makes you more of an angel to want this job too.\" ", "And she playfully whacked her smaller companion. ", "\"I'm not an angel-I'm an old grandmother,\" Sir Claude declared. ", "\" I like babies-I always did. ", "If we go to smash I shall look for a place as responsible nurse. ", "\" Maisie, in her charmed mood, drank in an imputation on her years which at another moment might have been bitter; ", "but the charm was sensibly interrupted by Mrs. Beale's screwing her round and gazing fondly into her eyes, \"You're willing to leave me, you wretch?

", "\" I'm so glad you really care for her. ", "That's so much to the good.\" ", "Mrs. Beale slowly got up, still with her hands on Maisie, but emitting a soft exhalation. ", "\" Well, if you're glad, that may help us; ", "for I assure you that I shall never give up any rights in her that I may consider I've acquired by my own sacrifices. ", "I shall hold very fast to my interest in her. ", "What seems to have happened is that she has brought you and me together.\" ", "\"She has brought you and me together,\" said Sir Claude.

", "\" You little monster-take care what you do! ", "But that's what she does do,\" she continued to Sir Claude. ", "\" She did it to me and Beale.\" ", "\"Well then,\" he said to Maisie, \"you must try the trick at our place.\" ", "He held out his hand to her again. \" ", "Will you come now?\" ", "\"Now-just as I am? ", "\" She turned with an immense appeal to her stepmother, taking a leap over the mountain of \"mending,\" the abyss of packing that had loomed and yawned before her.

", "I'll send on her things to-morrow.\" ", "Then she gave a tug to the child's coat, glancing at her up and down with some ruefulness. ", "\"She's not turned out as I should like-her mother will pull her to pieces. ", "But what's one to do-with nothing to do it on?

", "\"I shall like to see how!\"-Mrs. ", "Beale appeared much amused. ", "\" You must bring her to show me-we can manage that. ", "Good-bye, little fright!\" ", "And her last word to Sir Claude was that she would keep him up to the mark. ", "IX    ", "The idea of what she was to make up and the prodigious total it came to were kept well before Maisie at her mother's. ", "These things were the constant occupation of Mrs. Wix, who arrived there by the back stairs, but in tears of joy, the day after her own arrival. ", "The process of making up, as to which the good lady had an immense deal to say, took, through its successive phases, so long that it heralded a term at least equal to the child's last stretch with her father. ", "This, however, was a fuller and richer time: ", "it bounded along to the tune of Mrs. Wix's constant insistence on the energy they must both put forth. ", "There was a fine intensity in the way the child agreed with her that under Mrs. Beale and Susan Ash she had learned nothing whatever; ", "the wildness of the rescued castaway was one of the forces that would henceforth make for a career of conquest. ", "The year therefore rounded itself as a receptacle of retarded knowledge-a cup brimming over with the sense that now at least she was learning. ", "Mrs. Wix fed this sense from the stores of her conversation and with the immense bustle of her reminder that they must cull the fleeting hour. ", "They were surrounded with subjects they must take at a rush and perpetually getting into the attitude of triumphant attack. ", "They had certainly no idle hours, and the child went to bed each night as tired as from a long day's play. ", "This had begun from the moment of their reunion, begun with all Mrs. Wix had to tell her young friend of the reasons of her ladyship's extraordinary behaviour at the very first. ", "It took the form of her ladyship's refusal for three days to see her little girl-three days during which Sir Claude made hasty merry dashes into the schoolroom to smooth down the odd situation, to say \"She'll come round, you know; ", "I assure you she'll come round,\" and a little even to compensate Maisie for the indignity he had caused her to suffer. ", "There had never in the child's life been, in all ways, such a delightful amount of reparation. ", "It came out by his sociable admission that her ladyship had not known of his visit to her late husband's house and of his having made that person's daughter a pretext for striking up an acquaintance with the dreadful creature installed there. ", "Heaven knew she wanted her child back and had made every plan of her own for removing her; ", "what she couldn't for the present at least forgive any one concerned was such an officious underhand way of bringing about the transfer. ", "Maisie carried more of the weight of this resentment than even Mrs. Wix's confidential ingenuity could lighten for her, especially as Sir Claude himself was not at all ingenious, though indeed on the other hand he was not at all crushed. ", "He was amused and intermittent and at moments most startling; ", "he impressed on his young companion, with a frankness that agitated her much more than he seemed to guess, that he depended on her not letting her mother, when she should see her, get anything out of her about anything Mrs. Beale might have said to him. ", "He came in and out; ", "he professed, in joke, to take tremendous precautions; ", "he showed a positive disposition to romp. ", "He chaffed Mrs. Wix till she was purple with the pleasure of it, and reminded Maisie of the reticence he expected of her till she set her teeth like an Indian captive. ", "Her lessons these first days and indeed for long after seemed to be all about Sir Claude, and yet she never really mentioned to Mrs. Wix that she was prepared, under his inspiring injunction, to be vainly tortured. ", "This lady, however, had formulated the position of things with an acuteness that showed how little she needed to be coached. ", "Her explanation of everything that seemed not quite pleasant-and if her own footing was perilous it met that danger as well-that her ladyship was passionately in love. ", "Maisie accepted this hint with infinite awe and pressed upon it much when she was at last summoned into the presence of her mother. ", "There she encountered matters amid which it seemed really to help to give her a clue-an almost terrifying strangeness, full, none the less, after a little, of reverberations of Ida's old fierce and demonstrative recoveries of possession. ", "They had been some time in the house together, and this demonstration came late. ", "Preoccupied, however, as Maisie was with the idea of the sentiment Sir Claude had inspired, and familiar, in addition, by Mrs. Wix's anecdotes, with the ravages that in general such a sentiment could produce, she was able to make allowances for her ladyship's remarkable appearance, her violent splendour, the wonderful colour of her lips and even the hard stare, the stare of some gorgeous idol described in a story-book, that had come into her eyes in consequence of a curious thickening of their already rich circumference. ", "Her professions and explanations were mixed with eager challenges and sudden drops, in the midst of which Maisie recognised as a memory of other years the rattle of her trinkets and the scratch of her endearments, the odour of her clothes and the jumps of her conversation. ", "She had all her old clever way-Mrs. Wix said it was \"aristocratic\"-of changing the subject as she might have slammed the door in your face. ", "The principal thing that was different was the tint of her golden hair, which had changed to a coppery red and, with the head it profusely covered, struck the child as now lifted still further aloft. ", "This picturesque parent showed literally a grander stature and a nobler presence, things which, with some others that might have been bewildering, were handsomely accounted for by the romantic state of her affections. ", "It was her affections, Maisie could easily see, that led Ida to break out into questions as to what had passed at the other house between that horrible woman and Sir Claude; ", "but it was also just here that the little girl was able to recall the effect with which in earlier days she had practised the pacific art of stupidity. ", "This art again came to her aid: ", "her mother, in getting rid of her after an interview in which she had achieved a hollowness beyond her years, allowed her fully to understand she had not grown a bit more amusing. ", "She could bear that; ", "she could bear anything that helped her to feel she had done something for Sir Claude. ", "If she hadn't told Mrs. Wix how Mrs. Beale seemed to like him she certainly couldn't tell her ladyship. ", "In the way the past revived for her there was a queer confusion. ", "It was because mamma hated papa that she used to want to know bad things of him; ", "but if at present she wanted to know the same of Sir Claude it was quite from the opposite motive. ", "She was awestruck at the manner in which a lady might be affected through the passion mentioned by Mrs. Wix; ", "she held her breath with the sense of picking her steps among the tremendous things of life. ", "What she did, however, now, after the interview with her mother, impart to Mrs. Wix was that, in spite of her having had her \"good\" effect, as she called it-the effect she studied, the effect of harmless vacancy-her ladyship's last words had been that her ladyship's duty by her would be thoroughly done. ", "Over this announcement governess and pupil looked at each other in silent profundity; ", "but as the weeks went by it had no consequences that interfered gravely with the breezy gallop of making up. ", "Her ladyship's duty took at times the form of not seeing her child for days together, and Maisie led her life in great prosperity between Mrs. Wix and kind Sir Claude. ", "Mrs. Wix had a new dress and, as she was the first to proclaim, a better position; ", "so it all struck Maisie as a crowded brilliant life, with, for the time, Mrs. Beale and Susan Ash simply \"left out\" like children not invited to a Christmas party. ", "Mrs. Wix had a secret terror which, like most of her secret feelings, she discussed with her little companion, in great solemnity, by the hour: ", "the possibility of her ladyship's coming down on them, in her sudden highbred way, with a school. ", "But she had also a balm to this fear in a conviction of the strength of Sir Claude's grasp of the situation. ", "He was too pleased-didn't he constantly say as much?-with the good impression made, in a wide circle, by Ida's sacrifices; ", "and he came into the schoolroom repeatedly to let them know how beautifully he felt everything had gone off and everything would go on. ", "He disappeared at times for days, when his patient friends understood that her ladyship would naturally absorb him; ", "but he always came back with the drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of society, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he thought of his home. ", "Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation a sense that they almost themselves \"went out,\" he gave her a five-pound note and the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to Maisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat (which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games in boxes, with printed directions, and a bright red frame for the protection of his famous photograph. ", "The games were, as he said, to while away the evening hour; ", "and the evening hour indeed often passed in futile attempts on Mrs. Wix's part to master what \"it said\" on the papers. ", "When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always replied \"Oh immensely!\" ", "but they had earnest discussions as to whether they hadn't better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them. ", "This was a course their delicacy shrank from; ", "they couldn't have told exactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let him think they had trouble. ", "What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs. Wix, not only the five-pound note and the \"not forgetting\" her, but the perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her sounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together. ", "He shook hands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than once, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the crowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm. ", "When he met them in sunny Piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism that-needless for Mrs. Wix to sound those words-her ladyship, though a blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of. ", "Even to the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation at such humanities: ", "it brought home to Maisie the way her humble companion had sidled and ducked through life. ", "But it settled the question of the degree to which Sir Claude was a gentleman: ", "he was more of one than anybody else in the world-\"I don't care,\" Mrs. Wix repeatedly remarked, \"whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to whom you may be contracted in marriage. ", "\" There were questions that Maisie never asked; ", "so her governess was spared the embarrassment of telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa. ", "This was not moreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between them at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going into, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it was further off than the turn of the page. ", "The answer on the winter nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; ", "and if the truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time the little girl's chief education. ", "It must also be admitted that he took them far, further perhaps than was always warranted by the old-fashioned conscience, the dingy decencies, of Maisie's simple instructress. ", "There were hours when Mrs. Wix sighingly testified to the scruples she surmounted, seemed to ask what other line one could take with a young person whose experience had been, as it were, so peculiar. ", "\" It isn't as if you didn't already know everything, is it, love?\" ", "and \"I can't make you any worse than you are, can I, darling?\"-these were the terms in which the good lady justified to herself and her pupil her pleasant conversational ease. ", "What the pupil already knew was indeed rather taken for granted than expressed, but it performed the useful function of transcending all textbooks and supplanting all studies. ", "If the child couldn't be worse it was a comfort even to herself that she was bad- ", "a comfort offering a broad firm support to the fundamental fact of the present crisis: ", "the fact that mamma was fearfully jealous. ", "This was another side of the circumstance of mamma's passion, and the deep couple in the schoolroom were not long in working round to it. ", "It brought them face to face with the idea of the inconvenience suffered by any lady who marries a gentleman producing on other ladies the charming effect of Sir Claude. ", "That such ladies wouldn't be able to help falling in love with him was a reflexion naturally irritating to his wife. ", "One day when some accident, some crash of a banged door or some scurry of a scared maid, had rendered this truth particularly vivid, Maisie, receptive and profound, suddenly said to her companion: ", "And you, my dear, are you in love with him too? ", "\" Even her profundity had left a margin for a laugh; ", "so she was a trifle startled by the solemn promptitude with which Mrs. Wix plumped out: ", "Over head and ears. ", "I've never since you ask me, been so far gone.\" ", "This boldness had none the less no effect of deterrence for her when, a few days later-it was because several had elapsed without a visit from Sir Claude-her governess turned the tables. ", "May I ask you, miss, if you are?\" ", "Mrs. Wix brought it out, she could see, with hesitation, but clearly intending a joke. ", "\" Why rather!\" ", "the child made answer, as if in surprise at not having long ago seemed sufficiently to commit herself; ", "on which her friend gave a sigh of apparent satisfaction. ", "It might in fact have expressed positive relief. ", "Everything was as it should be. ", "Yet it was not with them, they were very sure, that her ladyship was furious, nor because she had forbidden it that there befell at last a period-six months brought it round-when for days together he scarcely came near them. ", "He was \"off,\" and Ida was \"off,\" and they were sometimes off together and sometimes apart; ", "there were seasons when the simple students had the house to themselves, when the very servants seemed also to be \"off\" and dinner became a reckless forage in pantries and sideboards. ", "Mrs. Wix reminded her disciple on such occasions-hungry moments often, when all the support of the reminder was required-that the \"real life\" of their companions, the brilliant society in which it was inevitable they should move and the complicated pleasures in which it was almost presumptuous of the mind to follow them, must offer features literally not to be imagined without being seen. ", "At one of these times Maisie found her opening it out that, though the difficulties were many, it was Mrs. Beale who had now become the chief. ", "Then somehow it was brought fully to the child's knowledge that her stepmother had been making attempts to see her, that her mother had deeply resented it, that her stepfather had backed her stepmother up, that the latter had pretended to be acting as the representative of her father, and that her mother took the whole thing, in plain terms, very hard. ", "The situation was, as Mrs. Wix declared, an extraordinary muddle to be sure. ", "Her account of it brought back to Maisie the happy vision of the way Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale had made acquaintance-an incident to which, with her stepfather, though she had had little to say about it to Mrs. Wix, she had during the first weeks of her stay at her mother's found more than one opportunity to revert. ", "As to what had taken place the day Sir Claude came for her, she had been vaguely grateful to Mrs. Wix for not attempting, as her mother had attempted, to put her through. ", "That was what Sir Claude had called the process when he warned her of it, and again afterwards when he told her she was an awfully good \"chap\" for having foiled it. ", "Then it was that, well aware Mrs. Beale hadn't in the least really given her up, she had asked him if he remained in communication with her and if for the time everything must really be held to be at an end between her stepmother and herself. ", "This conversation had occurred in consequence of his one day popping into the schoolroom and finding Maisie alone. ", "X    ", "He was smoking a cigarette and he stood before the fire and looked at the meagre appointments of the room in a way that made her rather ashamed of them. ", "Then before (on the subject of Mrs. Beale) he let her \"draw\" him-that was another of his words; ", "it was astonishing how many she gathered in-he remarked that really mamma kept them rather low on the question of decorations. ", "Mrs. Wix had put up a Japanese fan and two rather grim texts; ", "she had wished they were gayer, but they were all she happened to have. ", "Without Sir Claude's photograph, however, the place would have been, as he said, as dull as a cold dinner. ", "He had said as well that there were all sorts of things they ought to have; ", "yet governess and pupil, it had to be admitted, were still divided between discussing the places where any sort of thing would look best if any sort of thing should ever come and acknowledging that mutability in the child's career which was naturally unfavourable to accumulation. ", "She stayed long enough only to miss things, not half long enough to deserve them. ", "The way Sir Claude looked about the schoolroom had made her feel with humility as if it were not very different from the shabby attic in which she had visited Susan Ash. ", "Then he had said in abrupt reference to Mrs. Beale: ", "Do you think she really cares for you?\" ", "\"Oh awfully! ", "\" Maisie had replied. ", "But, I mean, does she love you for yourself, as they call it, don't you know? ", "Is she as fond of you, now, as Mrs. Wix? ", "\" The child turned it over. ", "Oh I'm not every bit Mrs. Beale has!\" ", "Sir Claude seemed much amused at this. \" ", "No; ", "you're not every bit she has!\" ", "He laughed for some moments, but that was an old story to Maisie, who was not too much disconcerted to go on: ", "But she'll never give me up.\" ", "\"Well, I won't either, old boy: ", "so that's not so wonderful, and she's not the only one. ", "But if she's so fond of you, why doesn't she write to you?\" ", "\"Oh on account of mamma. ", "\" This was rudimentary, and she was almost surprised at the simplicity of Sir Claude's question. ", "\"I see-that's quite right,\" he answered. ", "\" She might get at you-there are all sorts of ways. ", "But of course there's Mrs. Wix.\" ", "\"There's Mrs. Wix,\" Maisie lucidly concurred. ", "Mrs. Wix can't abide her.\" ", "Sir Claude seemed interested. ", "\" Oh she can't abide her? ", "Then what does she say about her?\" ", "\"Nothing at all-because she knows I shouldn't like it. ", "Isn't it sweet of her?\" ", "the child asked. \" ", "Certainly; ", "rather nice. ", "Mrs. Beale wouldn't hold her tongue for any such thing as that, would she? ", "Maisie remembered how little she had done so; ", "but she desired to protect Mrs. Beale too. ", "The only protection she could think of, however, was the plea: ", "Oh at papa's, you know, they don't mind! ", "At this Sir Claude only smiled. ", "No, I dare say not. ", "But here we mind, don't we?-we take care what we say. ", "I don't suppose it's a matter on which I ought to prejudice you,\" he went on; ", "but I think we must on the whole be rather nicer here than at your father's. ", "However, I don't press that; ", "for it's the sort of question on which it's awfully awkward for you to speak. ", "Don't worry, at any rate: ", "I assure you I'll back you up.\" ", "Then after a moment and while he smoked he reverted to Mrs. Beale and the child's first enquiry. ", "\" I'm afraid we can't do much for her just now. ", "I haven't seen her since that day-upon my word I haven't seen her. ", "\" The next instant, with a laugh the least bit foolish, the young man slightly coloured: ", "he must have felt this profession of innocence to be excessive as addressed to Maisie. ", "It was inevitable to say to her, however, that of course her mother loathed the lady of the other house. ", "He couldn't go there again with his wife's consent, and he wasn't the man-he begged her to believe, falling once more, in spite of himself, into the scruple of showing the child he didn't trip-to go there without it. ", "He was liable in talking with her to take the tone of her being also a man of the world. ", "He had gone to Mrs. Beale's to fetch away Maisie, but that was altogether different. ", "Now that she was in her mother's house what pretext had he to give her mother for paying calls on her father's wife? ", "And of course Mrs. Beale couldn't come to Ida's-Ida would tear her limb from limb. ", "Maisie, with this talk of pretexts, remembered how much Mrs. Beale had made of her being a good one, and how, for such a function, it was her fate to be either much depended on or much missed. ", "Sir Claude moreover recognised on this occasion that perhaps things would take a turn later on; ", "and he wound up by saying: ", "I'm sure she does sincerely care for you-how can she possibly help it? ", "She's very young and very pretty and very clever: ", "I think she's charming. ", "But we must walk very straight. ", "If you'll help me, you know, I'll help you,\" he concluded in the pleasant fraternising, equalising, not a bit patronising way which made the child ready to go through anything for him and the beauty of which, as she dimly felt, was that it was so much less a deceitful descent to her years than a real indifference to them. ", "It gave her moments of secret rapture-moments of believing she might help him indeed. ", "The only mystification in this was the imposing time of life that her elders spoke of as youth. ", "For Sir Claude then Mrs. Beale was \"young,\" just as for Mrs. Wix Sir Claude was: ", "that was one of the merits for which Mrs. Wix most commended him. ", "What therefore was Maisie herself, and, in another relation to the matter, what therefore was mamma? ", "It took her some time to puzzle out with the aid of an experiment or two that it wouldn't do to talk about mamma's youth. ", "She even went so far one day, in the presence of that lady's thick colour and marked lines, as to wonder if it would occur to any one but herself to do so. ", "Yet if she wasn't young then she was old; ", "and this threw an odd light on her having a husband of a different generation. ", "Mr. Farange was still older-that Maisie perfectly knew; ", "and it brought her in due course to the perception of how much more, since Mrs. Beale was younger than Sir Claude, papa must be older than Mrs. Beale. ", "Such discoveries were disconcerting and even a trifle confounding: ", "these persons, it appeared, were not of the age they ought to be. ", "This was somehow particularly the case with mamma, and the fact made her reflect with some relief on her not having gone with Mrs. Wix into the question of Sir Claude's attachment to his wife. ", "She was conscious that in confining their attention to the state of her ladyship's own affections they had been controlled-Mrs. Wix perhaps in especial-by delicacy and even by embarrassment. ", "The end of her colloquy with her stepfather in the schoolroom was her saying: ", "Then if we're not to see Mrs. Beale at all it isn't what she seemed to think when you came for me.\" ", "He looked rather blank. ", "\" What did she seem to think?\" ", "\"Why that I've brought you together.\" ", "\"She thought that?\" ", "Sir Claude asked. ", "Maisie was surprised at his already forgetting it. \" ", "Just as I had brought papa and her. ", "Don't you remember she said so? ", "\" It came back to Sir Claude in a peal of laughter. ", "\" Oh yes-she said so!\" ", "\"And you said so,\" Maisie lucidly pursued. ", "He recovered, with increasing mirth, the whole occasion. \" ", "And you said so!\" ", "he retorted as if they were playing a game. ", "\"Then were we all mistaken?\" ", "He considered a little. \" ", "No, on the whole not. ", "I dare say it's just what you have done. ", "We are together-it's really most odd. ", "She's thinking of us-of you and me-though we don't meet. ", "And I've no doubt you'll find it will be all right when you go back to her.\" ", "\"Am I going back to her? ", "Maisie brought out with a little gasp which was like a sudden clutch of the happy present. ", "It appeared to make Sir Claude grave a moment; ", "it might have made him feel the weight of the pledge his action had given. ", "\" Oh some day, I suppose! ", "We've plenty of time.\" ", "\"I've such a tremendous lot to make up,\" Maisie said with a sense of great boldness. \" ", "Certainly, and you must make up every hour of it. ", "Oh I'll see that you do! ", "\" This was encouraging; ", "and to show cheerfully that she was reassured she replied: ", "\"That's what Mrs. Wix sees too.\" ", "\"Oh yes,\" said Sir Claude; ", "\"Mrs. Wix and I are shoulder to shoulder. ", "\" Maisie took in a little this strong image; ", "after which she exclaimed: ", "Then I've done it also to you and her-I've brought you together!\" ", "\"Blest if you haven't!\" ", "Sir Claude laughed. \" ", "And more, upon my word, than any of the lot. ", "Oh you've done for us! ", "Now if you could-as I suggested, you know, that day-only manage me and your mother!\" ", "The child wondered. ", "\" Bring you and her together?\" ", "\"You see we're not together-not a bit. ", "But I oughtn't to tell you such things; ", "all the more that you won't really do it-not you. ", "No, old chap,\" the young man continued; ", "\"there you'll break down. ", "But it won't matter-we'll rub along. ", "The great thing is that you and I are all right.\" ", "\"We're all right!\" ", "Maisie echoed devoutly. ", "But the next moment, in the light of what he had just said, she asked: ", "How shall I ever leave you? ", "\" It was as if she must somehow take care of him. ", "His smile did justice to her anxiety. ", "\" Oh well, you needn't! ", "It won't come to that.\" ", "\"Do you mean that when I do go you'll go with me?\" ", "Sir Claude cast about. ", "\" Not exactly 'with' you perhaps; ", "but I shall never be far off.\" ", "\"But how do you know where mamma may take you?\" ", "He laughed again. ", "\" I don't, I confess!\" ", "Then he had an idea, though something too jocose. ", "\" That will be for you to see-that she shan't take me too far.\" ", "\"How can I help it?\" ", "Maisie enquired in surprise. ", "\" Mamma doesn't care for me,\" she said very simply. \" ", "Not really.\" ", "Child as she was, her little long history was in the words; ", "and it was as impossible to contradict her as if she had been venerable. ", "Sir Claude's silence was an admission of this, and still more the tone in which he presently replied: ", "That won't prevent her from-some time or other-leaving me with you.\" ", "\"Then we'll live together?\" ", "she eagerly demanded. ", "\"I'm afraid,\" said Sir Claude, smiling, \"that that will be Mrs. Beale's real chance. ", "\" Her eagerness just slightly dropped at this; ", "she remembered Mrs. Wix's pronouncement that it was all an extraordinary muddle. ", "\" To take me again? ", "Well, can't you come to see me there?\" ", "\"Oh I dare say!\" ", "Though there were parts of childhood Maisie had lost she had all childhood's preference for the particular promise. ", "\" Then you will come-you'll come often, won't you?\" ", "she insisted; ", "while at the moment she spoke the door opened for the return of Mrs. Wix. ", "Sir Claude hereupon, instead of replying, gave her a look which left her silent and embarrassed. ", "When he again found privacy convenient, however-which happened to be long in coming-he took up their conversation very much where it had dropped. ", "\" You see, my dear, if I shall be able to go to you at your father's it yet isn't at all the same thing for Mrs. Beale to come to you here. ", "\" Maisie gave a thoughtful assent to this proposition, though conscious she could scarcely herself say just where the difference would lie. ", "She felt how much her stepfather saved her, as he said with his habitual amusement, the trouble of that. ", "\" I shall probably be able to go to Mrs. Beale's without your mother's knowing it.\" ", "Maisie stared with a certain thrill at the dramatic element in this. \" ", "And she couldn't come here without mamma's-\" She was unable to articulate the word for what mamma would do. ", "\"My dear child, Mrs. Wix would tell of it.\" ", "\"But I thought,\" Maisie objected, \"that Mrs. Wix and you-\"  \"Are such brothers-in-arms?\"-Sir Claude caught her up. \" ", "Oh yes, about everything but Mrs. Beale. ", "And if you should suggest,\" he went on, \"that we might somehow or other hide her peeping in from Mrs. Wix-\"  \"Oh, I don't suggest that!\" ", "Maisie in turn cut him short. ", "Sir Claude looked as if he could indeed quite see why. \" ", "No; ", "it would really be impossible. ", "\" There came to her from this glance at what they might hide the first small glimpse of something in him that she wouldn't have expected. ", "There had been times when she had had to make the best of the impression that she was herself deceitful; ", "yet she had never concealed anything bigger than a thought. ", "Of course she now concealed this thought of how strange it would be to see him hide; ", "and while she was so actively engaged he continued: ", "Besides, you know, I'm not afraid of your father.\" ", "\"And you are of my mother?\" ", "\"Rather, old man!\" ", "Sir Claude returned. ", "XI    ", "It must not be supposed that her ladyship's intermissions were not qualified by demonstrations of another order-triumphal entries and breathless pauses during which she seemed to take of everything in the room, from the state of the ceiling to that of her daughter's boot-toes, a survey that was rich in intentions. ", "Sometimes she sat down and sometimes she surged about, but her attitude wore equally in either case the grand air of the practical. ", "She found so much to deplore that she left a great deal to expect, and bristled so with calculation that she seemed to scatter remedies and pledges. ", "Her visits were as good as an outfit; ", "her manner, as Mrs. Wix once said, as good as a pair of curtains; ", "but she was a person addicted to extremes-sometimes barely speaking to her child and sometimes pressing this tender shoot to a bosom cut, as Mrs. Wix had also observed, remarkably low. ", "She was always in a fearful hurry, and the lower the bosom was cut the more it was to be gathered she was wanted elsewhere. ", "She usually broke in alone, but sometimes Sir Claude was with her, and during all the earlier period there was nothing on which these appearances had had so delightful a bearing as on the way her ladyship was, as Mrs. Wix expressed it, under the spell. ", "\" But isn't she under it!\" ", "Maisie used in thoughtful but familiar reference to exclaim after Sir Claude had swept mamma away in peals of natural laughter. ", "Not even in the old days of the convulsed ladies had she heard mamma laugh so freely as in these moments of conjugal surrender, to the gaiety of which even a little girl could see she had at last a right-a little girl whose thoughtfulness was now all happy selfish meditation on good omens and future fun. ", "Unaccompanied, in subsequent hours, and with an effect of changing to meet a change, Ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and abrupt-the tone of having, at an immense cost, made over everything to Sir Claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasn't right it was because Sir Claude was so dreadfully vague. \" ", "He has made from the first such a row about you,\" she said on one occasion to Maisie, \"that I've told him to do for you himself and try how he likes it-see? ", "I've washed my hands of you; ", "I've made you over to him; ", "and if you're discontented it's on him, please, you'll come down. ", "So don't haul poor me up-I assure you I've worries enough. ", "\" One of these, visibly, was that the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger of breaking; ", "another was that she was finally forced to make no secret of her husband's unfitness for real responsibilities. ", "The day came indeed when her breathless auditors learnt from her in bewilderment that what ailed him was that he was, alas, simply not serious. ", "Maisie wept on Mrs. Wix's bosom after hearing that Sir Claude was a butterfly; ", "considering moreover that her governess but half-patched it up in coming out at various moments the next few days with the opinion that it was proper to his \"station\" to be careless and free. ", "That had been proper to every one's station that she had yet encountered save poor Mrs. Wix's own, and the particular merit of Sir Claude had seemed precisely that he was different from every one. ", "She talked with him, however, as time went on, very freely about her mother; ", "being with him, in this relation, wholly without the fear that had kept her silent before her father-the fear of bearing tales and making bad things worse. ", "He appeared to accept the idea that he had taken her over and made her, as he said, his particular lark; ", "he quite agreed also that he was an awful fraud and an idle beast and a sorry dunce. ", "And he never said a word to her against her mother-he only remained dumb and discouraged in the face of her ladyship's own overtopping earnestness. ", "There were occasions when he even spoke as if he had wrenched his little charge from the arms of a parent who had fought for her tooth and nail. ", "This was the very moral of a scene that flashed into vividness one day when the four happened to meet without company in the drawing-room and Maisie found herself clutched to her mother's breast and passionately sobbed and shrieked over, made the subject of a demonstration evidently sequent to some sharp passage just enacted. ", "The connexion required that while she almost cradled the child in her arms Ida should speak of her as hideously, as fatally estranged, and should rail at Sir Claude as the cruel author of the outrage. \" ", "He has taken you from me,\" she cried; ", "\"he has set you against me, and you've been won away and your horrid little mind has been poisoned! ", "You've gone over to him, you've given yourself up to side against me and hate me. ", "You never open your mouth to me-you know you don't; ", "and you chatter to him like a dozen magpies. ", "Don't lie about it-I hear you all over the place. ", "You hang about him in a way that's barely decent-he can do what he likes with you. ", "Well then, let him, to his heart's content: ", "he has been in such a hurry to take you that we'll see if it suits him to keep you. ", "I'm very good to break my heart about it when you've no more feeling for me than a clammy little fish!\" ", "She suddenly thrust the child away and, as a disgusted admission of failure, sent her flying across the room into the arms of Mrs. Wix, whom at this moment and even in the whirl of her transit Maisie saw, very red, exchange a quick queer look with Sir Claude. ", "The impression of the look remained with her, confronting her with such a critical little view of her mother's explosion that she felt the less ashamed of herself for incurring the reproach with which she had been cast off. ", "Her father had once called her a heartless little beast, and now, though decidedly scared, she was as stiff and cold as if the description had been just. ", "She was not even frightened enough to cry, which would have been a tribute to her mother's wrongs: ", "she was only, more than anything else, curious about the opinion mutely expressed by their companions. ", "Taking the earliest opportunity to question Mrs. Wix on this subject she elicited the remarkable reply: ", "Well, my dear, it's her ladyship's game, and we must just hold on like grim death. ", "\" Maisie could interpret at her leisure these ominous words. ", "Her reflexions indeed at this moment thickened apace, and one of them made her sure that her governess had conversations, private, earnest and not infrequent, with her denounced stepfather. ", "She perceived in the light of a second episode that something beyond her knowledge had taken place in the house. ", "The things beyond her knowledge-numerous enough in truth-had not hitherto, she believed, been the things that had been nearest to her: ", "she had even had in the past a small smug conviction that in the domestic labyrinth she always kept the clue. ", "This time too, however, she at last found out-with the discreet aid, it had to be confessed, of Mrs. Wix. ", "Sir Claude's own assistance was abruptly taken from her, for his comment on her ladyship's game was to start on the spot, quite alone, for Paris, evidently because he wished to show a spirit when accused of bad behaviour. ", "He might be fond of his stepdaughter, Maisie felt, without wishing her to be after all thrust on him in such a way; ", "his absence therefore, it was clear, was a protest against the thrusting. ", "It was while this absence lasted that our young lady finally discovered what had happened in the house to be that her mother was no longer in love. ", "The limit of a passion for Sir Claude had certainly been reached, she judged, some time before the day on which her ladyship burst suddenly into the schoolroom to introduce Mr. Perriam, who, as she announced from the doorway to Maisie, wouldn't believe his ears that one had a great hoyden of a daughter. ", "Mr. Perriam was short and massive-Mrs. Wix remarked afterwards that he was \"too fat for the pace\"; ", "and it would have been difficult to say of him whether his head were more bald or his black moustache more bushy. ", "He seemed also to have moustaches over his eyes, which, however, by no means prevented these polished little globes from rolling round the room as if they had been billiard-balls impelled by Ida's celebrated stroke. ", "Mr. Perriam wore on the hand that pulled his moustache a diamond of dazzling lustre, in consequence of which and of his general weight and mystery our young lady observed on his departure that if he had only had a turban he would have been quite her idea of a heathen Turk. ", "\"He's quite my idea,\" Mrs. Wix replied, \"of a heathen Jew.\" ", "\"Well, I mean,\" said Maisie, \"of a person who comes from the East.\" ", "\"That's where he must come from,\" her governess opined-\"he comes from the City. ", "\" In a moment she added as if she knew all about him. ", "He's one of those people who have lately broken out. ", "He'll be immensely rich.\" ", "\"On the death of his papa?\" the child interestedly enquired. ", "Dear no-nothing hereditary. ", "I mean he has made a mass of money.\" ", "\"How much, do you think? ", "\" Maisie demanded. ", "Mrs. Wix reflected and sketched it. ", "Oh many millions.\" ", "\"A hundred?\" ", "Mrs. Wix was not sure of the number, but there were enough of them to have seemed to warm up for the time the penury of the schoolroom-to linger there as an afterglow of the hot heavy light Mr. Perriam sensibly shed. ", "This was also, no doubt, on his part, an effect of that enjoyment of life with which, among her elders, Maisie had been in contact from her earliest years-the sign of happy maturity, the old familiar note of overflowing cheer. ", "\" How d'ye do, ma'am? ", "How d'ye do, little miss?\"-he laughed and nodded at the gaping figures. ", "\" She has brought me up for a peep-it's true I wouldn't take you on trust. ", "She's always talking about you, but she'd never produce you; ", "so to-day I challenged her on the spot. ", "Well, you ain't a myth, my dear-I back down on that,\" the visitor went on to Maisie; ", "\"nor you either, miss, though you might be, to be sure!\" ", "\"I bored him with you, darling-I bore every one,\" Ida said, \"and to prove that you are a sweet thing, as well as a fearfully old one, I told him he could judge for himself. ", "So now he sees that you're a dreadful bouncing business and that your poor old Mummy's at least sixty!\"-and her ladyship smiled at Mr. Perriam with the charm that her daughter had heard imputed to her at papa's by the merry gentlemen who had so often wished to get from him what they called a \"rise.\" ", "Her manner at that instant gave the child a glimpse more vivid than any yet enjoyed of the attraction that papa, in remarkable language, always denied she could put forth. ", "Mr. Perriam, however, clearly recognised it in the humour with which he met her. ", "\" I never said you ain't wonderful-did I ever say it, hey?\" ", "and he appealed with pleasant confidence to the testimony of the schoolroom, about which itself also he evidently felt something might be expected of him. \" ", "So this is their little place, hey? ", "Charming, charming, charming!\" ", "he repeated as he vaguely looked round. ", "The interrupted students clung together as if they had been personally exposed; ", "but Ida relieved their embarrassment by a hunch of her high shoulders. ", "This time the smile she addressed to Mr. Perriam had a beauty of sudden sadness. ", "What on earth is a poor woman to do? ", "\" The visitor's grimace grew more marked as he continued to look, and the conscious little schoolroom felt still more like a cage at a menagerie. \" ", "Charming, charming, charming!\" ", "Mr. Perriam insisted; ", "but the parenthesis closed with a prompt click. ", "\" There you are!\" said her ladyship. ", "By-bye!\" ", "she sharply added. ", "The next minute they were on the stairs, and Mrs. Wix and her companion, at the open door and looking mutely at each other, were reached by the sound of the large social current that carried them back to their life. ", "It was singular perhaps after this that Maisie never put a question about Mr. Perriam, and it was still more singular that by the end of a week she knew all she didn't ask. ", "What she most particularly knew-and the information came to her, unsought, straight from Mrs. Wix-was that Sir Claude wouldn't at all care for the visits of a millionaire who was in and out of the upper rooms. ", "How little he would care was proved by the fact that under the sense of them Mrs. Wix's discretion broke down altogether; ", "she was capable of a transfer of allegiance, capable, at the altar of propriety, of a desperate sacrifice of her ladyship. ", "As against Mrs. Beale, she more than once intimated, she had been willing to do the best for her, but as against Sir Claude she could do nothing for her at all. ", "It was extraordinary the number of things that, still without a question, Maisie knew by the time her stepfather came back from Paris-came bringing her a splendid apparatus for painting in water-colours and bringing Mrs. Wix, by a lapse of memory that would have been droll if it had not been a trifle disconcerting, a second and even a more elegant umbrella. ", "He had forgotten all about the first, with which, buried in as many wrappers as a mummy of the Pharaohs, she wouldn't for the world have done anything so profane as use it. ", "Maisie knew above all that though she was now, by what she called an informal understanding, on Sir Claude's \"side,\" she had yet not uttered a word to him about Mr. Perriam. ", "That gentleman became therefore a kind of flourishing public secret, out of the depths of which governess and pupil looked at each other portentously from the time their friend was restored to them. ", "He was restored in great abundance, and it was marked that, though he appeared to have felt the need to take a stand against the risk of being too roughly saddled with the offspring of others, he at this period exposed himself more than ever before to the presumption of having created expectations. ", "If it had become now, for that matter, a question of sides, there was at least a certain amount of evidence as to where they all were. ", "Maisie of course, in such a delicate position, was on nobody's; ", "but Sir Claude had all the air of being on hers. ", "If therefore Mrs. Wix was on Sir Claude's, her ladyship on Mr. Perriam's and Mr. Perriam presumably on her ladyship's, this left only Mrs. Beale and Mr. Farange to account for. ", "Mrs. Beale clearly was, like Sir Claude, on Maisie's, and papa, it was to be supposed, on Mrs. Beale's. ", "Here indeed was a slight ambiguity, as papa's being on Mrs. Beale's didn't somehow seem to place him quite on his daughter's. ", "It sounded, as this young lady thought it over, very much like puss-in-the-corner, and she could only wonder if the distribution of parties would lead to a rushing to and fro and a changing of places. ", "She was in the presence, she felt, of restless change: ", "wasn't it restless enough that her mother and her stepfather should already be on different sides? ", "That was the great thing that had domestically happened. ", "Mrs. Wix, besides, had turned another face: ", "she had never been exactly gay, but her gravity was now an attitude as public as a posted placard. ", "She seemed to sit in her new dress and brood over her lost delicacy, which had become almost as doleful a memory as that of poor Clara Matilda. ", "\" It is hard for him,\" she often said to her companion; ", "and it was surprising how competent on this point Maisie was conscious of being to agree with her. ", "Hard as it was, however, Sir Claude had never shown to greater advantage than in the gallant generous sociable way he carried it off: ", "a way that drew from Mrs. Wix a hundred expressions of relief at his not having suffered it to embitter him. ", "It threw him more and more at last into the schoolroom, where he had plainly begun to recognise that if he was to have the credit of perverting the innocent child he might also at least have the amusement. ", "He never came into the place without telling its occupants that they were the nicest people in the house-a remark which always led them to say to each other \"Mr. Perriam!\" as loud as ever compressed lips and enlarged eyes could make them articulate. ", "He caused Maisie to remember what she had said to Mrs. Beale about his having the nature of a good nurse, and, rather more than she intended before Mrs. Wix, to bring the whole thing out by once remarking to him that none of her good nurses had smoked quite so much in the nursery. ", "This had no more effect than it was meant to on his cigarettes: ", "he was always smoking, but always declaring that it was death to him not to lead a domestic life. ", "He led one after all in the schoolroom, and there were hours of late evening, when she had gone to bed, that Maisie knew he sat there talking with Mrs. Wix of how to meet his difficulties. ", "His consideration for this unfortunate woman even in the midst of them continued to show him as the perfect gentleman and lifted the subject of his courtesy into an upper air of beatitude in which her very pride had the hush of anxiety. \" ", "He leans on me-he leans on me!\" ", "she only announced from time to time; ", "and she was more surprised than amused when, later on, she accidentally found she had given her pupil the impression of a support literally supplied by her person. ", "This glimpse of a misconception led her to be explicit-to put before the child, with an air of mourning indeed for such a stoop to the common, that what they talked about in the small hours, as they said, was the question of his taking right hold of life. ", "The life she wanted him to take right hold of was the public: ", "\"she\" being, I hasten to add, in this connexion, not the mistress of his fate, but only Mrs. Wix herself. ", "She had phrases about him that were full of easy understanding, yet full of morality. \" ", "He's a wonderful nature, but he can't live like the lilies. ", "He's all right, you know, but he must have a high interest. ", "She had more than once remarked that his affairs were sadly involved, but that they must get him-Maisie and she together apparently-into Parliament. ", "The child took it from her with a flutter of importance that Parliament was his natural sphere, and she was the less prepared to recognise a hindrance as she had never heard of any affairs whatever that were not involved. ", "She had in the old days once been told by Mrs. Beale that her very own were, and with the refreshment of knowing that she had affairs the information hadn't in the least overwhelmed her. ", "It was true and perhaps a little alarming that she had never heard of any such matters since then. ", "Full of charm at any rate was the prospect of some day getting Sir Claude in; ", "especially after Mrs. Wix, as the fruit of more midnight colloquies, once went so far as to observe that she really believed it was all that was wanted to save him. ", "This critic, with these words, struck her disciple as cropping up, after the manner of mamma when mamma talked, quite in a new place. ", "The child stared as at the jump of a kangaroo. ", "\" Save him from what?\" ", "Mrs. Wix debated, then covered a still greater distance. ", "\" Why just from awful misery.\" ", "XII    ", "She had not at the moment explained her ominous speech, but the light of remarkable events soon enabled her companion to read it. ", "It may indeed be said that these days brought on a high quickening of Maisie's direct perceptions, of her sense of freedom to make out things for herself. ", "This was helped by an emotion intrinsically far from sweet-the increase of the alarm that had most haunted her meditations. ", "She had no need to be told, as on the morrow of the revelation of Sir Claude's danger she was told by Mrs. Wix, that her mother wanted more and more to know why the devil her father didn't send for her: ", "she had too long expected mamma's curiosity on this point to express itself sharply. ", "Maisie could meet such pressure so far as meeting it was to be in a position to reply, in words directly inspired, that papa would be hanged before he'd again be saddled with her. ", "She therefore recognised the hour that in troubled glimpses she had long foreseen, the hour when-the phrase for it came back to her from Mrs. Beale-with two fathers, two mothers and two homes, six protections in all, she shouldn't know \"wherever\" to go. ", "Such apprehension as she felt on this score was not diminished by the fact that Mrs. Wix herself was suddenly white with terror: ", "a circumstance leading Maisie to the further knowledge that this lady was still more scared on her own behalf than on that of her pupil. ", "A governess who had only one frock was not likely to have either two fathers or two mothers: ", "accordingly if even with these resources Maisie was to be in the streets, where in the name of all that was dreadful was poor Mrs. Wix to be? ", "She had had, it appeared, a tremendous brush with Ida, which had begun and ended with the request that she would be pleased on the spot to \"bundle. ", "\" It had come suddenly but completely, this signal of which she had gone in fear. ", "The companions confessed to each other the dread each had hidden the worst of, but Mrs. Wix was better off than Maisie in having a plan of defence. ", "She declined indeed to communicate it till it was quite mature; ", "but meanwhile, she hastened to declare, her feet were firm in the schoolroom. ", "They could only be loosened by force: ", "she would \"leave\" for the police perhaps, but she wouldn't leave for mere outrage. ", "That would be to play her ladyship's game, and it would take another turn of the screw to make her desert her darling. ", "Her ladyship had come down with extraordinary violence: ", "it had been one of many symptoms of a situation strained-\"between them all,\" as Mrs. Wix said, \"but especially between the two\"-to the point of God only knew what. ", "Her description of the crisis made the child blanch. \" ", "Between which two?-papa and mamma?\" ", "\"Dear no. ", "I mean between your mother and him. ", "\" Maisie, in this, recognised an opportunity to be really deep. \"' Him'?-Mr. ", "Perriam? ", "\" She fairly brought a blush to the scared face. ", "Well, my dear, I must say what you don't know ain't worth mentioning. ", "That it won't go on for ever with Mr. Perriam-since I must meet you-you can suppose? ", "But I meant dear Sir Claude. ", "Maisie stood corrected rather than abashed. ", "\" I see. ", "But it's about Mr. Perriam he's angry?\" ", "Mrs. Wix waited. \" ", "He says he's not.\" ", "\"Not angry? ", "He has told you so?\" ", "Mrs. Wix looked at her hard. \" ", "Not about him!\" ", "\"Then about some one else?\" ", "Mrs. Wix looked at her harder. ", "About some one else.\" ", "\"Lord Eric? ", "\" the child promptly brought forth. ", "At this, of a sudden, her governess was more agitated. ", "\" Oh why, little unfortunate, should we discuss their dreadful names?\"-and she threw herself for the millionth time on Maisie's neck. ", "It took her pupil but a moment to feel that she quivered with insecurity, and, the contact of her terror aiding, the pair in another instant were sobbing in each other's arms. ", "Then it was that, completely relaxed, demoralised as she had never been, Mrs. Wix suffered her wound to bleed and her resentment to gush. ", "Her great bitterness was that Ida had called her false, denounced her hypocrisy and duplicity, reviled her spying and tattling, her lying and grovelling to Sir Claude. ", "Me, me!\" ", "the poor woman wailed, \"who've seen what I've seen and gone through everything only to cover her up and ease her off and smooth her down? ", "If I've been an 'ipocrite it's the other way round: ", "I've pretended, to him and to her, to myself and to you and to every one, not to see! ", "It serves me right to have held my tongue before such horrors!\" ", "What horrors they were her companion forbore too closely to enquire, showing even signs not a few of an ability to take them for granted. ", "That put the couple more than ever, in this troubled sea, in the same boat, so that with the consciousness of ideas on the part of her fellow mariner Maisie could sit close and wait. ", "Sir Claude on the morrow came in to tea, and then the ideas were produced. ", "It was extraordinary how the child's presence drew out their full strength. ", "The principal one was startling, but Maisie appreciated the courage with which her governess handled it. ", "It simply consisted of the proposal that whenever and wherever they should seek refuge Sir Claude should consent to share their asylum. ", "On his protesting with all the warmth in nature against this note of secession she asked what else in the world was left to them if her ladyship should stop supplies. \" ", "Supplies be hanged, my dear woman!\" said their delightful friend. \" ", "Leave supplies to me-I'll take care of supplies.\" ", "Mrs. Wix rose to it. \" ", "Well, it's exactly because I knew you'd be so glad to do so that I put the question before you. ", "There's a way to look after us better than any other. ", "The way's just to come along with us. ", "It hung before Maisie, Mrs. Wix's way, like a glittering picture, and she clasped her hands in ecstasy. ", "\" Come along, come along, come along!\" ", "Sir Claude looked from his stepdaughter back to her governess. ", "\" Do you mean leave this house and take up my abode with you?\" ", "\"It will be the right thing-if you feel as you've told me you feel.\" ", "Mrs. Wix, sustained and uplifted, was now as clear as a bell. ", "Sir Claude had the air of trying to recall what he had told her; ", "then the light broke that was always breaking to make his face more pleasant. ", "\" It's your happy thought that I shall take a house for you?\" ", "\"For the wretched homeless child. ", "Any roof-over our heads-will do for us; ", "but of course for you it will have to be something really nice.\" ", "Sir Claude's eyes reverted to Maisie, rather hard, as she thought; ", "and there was a shade in his very smile that seemed to show her-though she also felt it didn't show Mrs. Wix-that the accommodation prescribed must loom to him pretty large. ", "The next moment, however, he laughed gaily enough. ", "\" My dear lady, you exaggerate tremendously my poor little needs.\" ", "Mrs. Wix had once mentioned to her young friend that when Sir Claude called her his dear lady he could do anything with her; ", "and Maisie felt a certain anxiety to see what he would do now. ", "Well, he only addressed her a remark of which the child herself was aware of feeling the force. ", "Your plan appeals to me immensely; ", "but of course-don't you see-I shall have to consider the position I put myself in by leaving my wife.\" ", "\"You'll also have to remember,\" Mrs. Wix replied, \"that if you don't look out your wife won't give you time to consider. ", "Her ladyship will leave you.\" ", "\"Ah my good friend, I do look out!\" ", "the young man returned while Maisie helped herself afresh to bread and butter. ", "Of course if that happens I shall have somehow to turn round; ", "but I hope with all my heart it won't. ", "I beg your pardon,\" he continued to his stepdaughter, \"for appearing to discuss that sort of possibility under your sharp little nose. ", "But the fact is I forget half the time that Ida's your sainted mother.\" ", "\"So do I!\" said Maisie, her mouth full of bread and butter and to put him the more in the right. ", "Her protectress, at this, was upon her again. ", "The little desolate precious pet!\" ", "For the rest of the conversation she was enclosed in Mrs. Wix's arms, and as they sat there interlocked Sir Claude, before them with his tea-cup, looked down at them in deepening thought. ", "Shrink together as they might they couldn't help, Maisie felt, being a very large lumpish image of what Mrs. Wix required of his slim fineness. ", "She knew moreover that this lady didn't make it better by adding in a moment: ", "Of course we shouldn't dream of a whole house. ", "Any sort of little lodging, however humble, would be only too blest.\" ", "\"But it would have to be something that would hold us all,\" said Sir Claude. ", "\"Oh yes,\" Mrs. Wix concurred; ", "\"the whole point's our being together. ", "While you're waiting, before you act, for her ladyship to take some step, our position here will come to an impossible pass. ", "You don't know what I went through with her for you yesterday-and for our poor darling; ", "but it's not a thing I can promise you often to face again. ", "She cast me out in horrible language-she has instructed the servants not to wait on me.\" ", "\"Oh the poor servants are all right!\" ", "Sir Claude eagerly cried. ", "\"They're certainly better than their mistress. ", "It's too dreadful that I should sit here and say of your wife, Sir Claude, and of Maisie's own mother, that she's lower than a domestic; ", "but my being betrayed into such remarks is just a reason the more for our getting away. ", "I shall stay till I'm taken by the shoulders, but that may happen any day. ", "What also may perfectly happen, you must permit me to repeat, is that she'll go off to get rid of us.\" ", "\"Oh if she'll only do that!\" ", "Sir Claude laughed. ", "\" That would be the very making of us!\" ", "\"Don't say it-don't say it!\" ", "Mrs. Wix pleaded. ", "\" Don't speak of anything so fatal. ", "You know what I mean. ", "We must all cling to the right. ", "You mustn't be bad.\" ", "Sir Claude set down his tea-cup; ", "he had become more grave and he pensively wiped his moustache. \" ", "Won't all the world say I'm awful if I leave the house before-before she has bolted? ", "They'll say it was my doing so that made her bolt. ", "\" Maisie could grasp the force of this reasoning, but it offered no check to Mrs. Wix. ", "\" Why need you mind that-if you've done it for so high a motive? ", "Think of the beauty of it,\" the good lady pressed. \" ", "Of bolting with you?\" ", "Sir Claude ejaculated. ", "She faintly smiled-she even faintly coloured. ", "So far from doing you harm it will do you the highest good. ", "Sir Claude, if you'll listen to me, it will save you.\" ", "\"Save me from what? ", "Maisie, at this question, waited with renewed suspense for an answer that would bring the thing to some finer point than their companion had brought it to before. ", "But there was on the contrary only more mystification in Mrs. Wix's reply. ", "\" Ah from you know what!\" ", "\"Do you mean from some other woman!\" ", "\"Yes-from a real bad one.\" ", "Sir Claude at least, the child could see, was not mystified; ", "so little indeed that a smile of intelligence broke afresh in his eyes. ", "He turned them in vague discomfort to Maisie, and then something in the way she met them caused him to chuck her playfully under the chin. ", "It was not till after this that he good-naturedly met Mrs. Wix. ", "\" You think me much worse than I am.\" ", "\"If that were true,\" she returned, \"I wouldn't appeal to you. ", "I do, Sir Claude, in the name of all that's good in you-and oh so earnestly! ", "We can help each other. ", "What you'll do for our young friend here I needn't say. ", "That isn't even what I want to speak of now. ", "What I want to speak of is what you'll get-don't you see?-from such an opportunity to take hold. ", "Take hold of us-take hold of her. ", "Make her your duty-make her your life: ", "she'll repay you a thousand-fold!\" ", "It was to Mrs. Wix, during this appeal, that Maisie's contemplation transferred itself: ", "partly because, though her heart was in her throat for trepidation, her delicacy deterred her from appearing herself to press the question; ", "partly from the coercion of seeing Mrs. Wix come out as Mrs. Wix had never come before-not even on the day of her call at Mrs. Beale's with the news of mamma's marriage. ", "On that day Mrs. Beale had surpassed her in dignity, but nobody could have surpassed her now. ", "There was in fact at this moment a fascination for her pupil in the hint she seemed to give that she had still more of that surprise behind. ", "So the sharpened sense of spectatorship was the child's main support, the long habit, from the first, of seeing herself in discussion and finding in the fury of it-she had had a glimpse of the game of football-a sort of compensation for the doom of a peculiar passivity. ", "It gave her often an odd air of being present at her history in as separate a manner as if she could only get at experience by flattening her nose against a pane of glass. ", "Such she felt to be the application of her nose while she waited for the effect of Mrs. Wix's eloquence. ", "Sir Claude, however, didn't keep her long in a position so ungraceful: ", "he sat down and opened his arms to her as he had done the day he came for her at her father's, and while he held her there, looking at her kindly, but as if their companion had brought the blood a good deal to his face, he said: ", "\"Dear Mrs. Wix is magnificent, but she's rather too grand about it. ", "I mean the situation isn't after all quite so desperate or quite so simple. ", "But I give you my word before her, and I give it to her before you, that I'll never, never, forsake you. ", "Do you hear that, old fellow, and do you take it in? ", "I'll stick to you through everything. ", "\" Maisie did take it in-took it with a long tremor of all her little being; ", "and then as, to emphasise it, he drew her closer she buried her head on his shoulder and cried without sound and without pain. ", "While she was so engaged she became aware that his own breast was agitated, and gathered from it with rapture that his tears were as silently flowing. ", "Presently she heard a loud sob from Mrs. Wix-Mrs. Wix was the only one who made a noise. ", "She was to have made, for some time, none other but this, though within a few days, in conversation with her pupil, she described her intercourse with Ida as little better than the state of being battered. ", "There was as yet nevertheless no attempt to eject her by force, and she recognised that Sir Claude, taking such a stand as never before, had intervened with passion and with success. ", "As Maisie remembered-and remembered wholly without disdain-that he had told her he was afraid of her ladyship, the little girl took this act of resolution as a proof of what, in the spirit of the engagement sealed by all their tears, he was really prepared to do. ", "Mrs. Wix spoke to her of the pecuniary sacrifice by which she herself purchased the scant security she enjoyed and which, if it was a defence against the hand of violence, yet left her exposed to incredible rudeness. ", "Didn't her ladyship find every hour of the day some artful means to humiliate and trample upon her? ", "There was a quarter's salary owing her-a great name, even Maisie could suspect, for a small matter; ", "she should never see it as long as she lived, but keeping quiet about it put her ladyship, thank heaven, a little in one's power. ", "Now that he was doing so much else she could never have the grossness to apply for it to Sir Claude. ", "He had sent home for schoolroom consumption a huge frosted cake, a wonderful delectable mountain with geological strata of jam, which might, with economy, see them through many days of their siege; ", "but it was none the less known to Mrs. Wix that his affairs were more and more involved, and her fellow partaker looked back tenderly, in the light of these involutions, at the expression of face with which he had greeted the proposal that he should set up another establishment. ", "Maisie felt that if their maintenance should hang by a thread they must still demean themselves with the highest delicacy. ", "What he was doing was simply acting without delay, so far as his embarrassments permitted, on the inspiration of his elder friend. ", "There was at this season a wonderful month of May-as soft as a drop of the wind in a gale that had kept one awake-when he took out his stepdaughter with a fresh alacrity and they rambled the great town in search, as Mrs. Wix called it, of combined amusement and instruction. ", "They rode on the top of 'buses; ", "they visited outlying parks; ", "they went to cricket-matches where Maisie fell asleep; ", "they tried a hundred places for the best one to have tea. ", "This was his direct way of rising to Mrs. Wix's grand lesson-of making his little accepted charge his duty and his life. ", "They dropped, under incontrollable impulses, into shops that they agreed were too big, to look at things that they agreed were too small, and it was during these hours that Mrs. Wix, alone at home, but a subject of regretful reference as they pulled off their gloves for refreshment, subsequently described herself as least sheltered from the blows her ladyship had achieved such ingenuity in dealing. ", "She again and again repeated that she wouldn't so much have minded having her \"attainments\" held up to scorn and her knowledge of every subject denied, hadn't she been branded as \"low\" in character and tone. ", "There was by this time no pretence on the part of any one of denying it to be fortunate that her ladyship habitually left London every Saturday and was more and more disposed to a return late in the week. ", "It was almost equally public that she regarded as a preposterous \"pose,\" and indeed as a direct insult to herself, her husband's attitude of staying behind to look after a child for whom the most elaborate provision had been made. ", "If there was a type Ida despised, Sir Claude communicated to Maisie, it was the man who pottered about town of a Sunday; ", "and he also mentioned how often she had declared to him that if he had a grain of spirit he would be ashamed to accept a menial position about Mr. Farange's daughter. ", "It was her ladyship's contention that he was in craven fear of his predecessor-otherwise he would recognise it as an obligation of plain decency to protect his wife against the outrage of that person's barefaced attempt to swindle her. ", "The swindle was that Mr. Farange put upon her the whole intolerable burden; ", "and even when I pay for you myself,\" Sir Claude averred to his young friend, \"she accuses me the more of truckling and grovelling. ", "\" It was Mrs. Wix's conviction, they both knew, arrived at on independent grounds, that Ida's weekly excursions were feelers for a more considerable absence. ", "If she came back later each week the week would be sure to arrive when she wouldn't come back at all. ", "This appearance had of course much to do with Mrs. Wix's actual valour. ", "Could they but hold out long enough the snug little home with Sir Claude would find itself informally established. ", "XIII    ", "This might moreover have been taken to be the sense of a remark made by her stepfather as-one rainy day when the streets were all splash and two umbrellas unsociable and the wanderers had sought shelter in the National Gallery-Maisie sat beside him staring rather sightlessly at a roomful of pictures which he had mystified her much by speaking of with a bored sigh as a \"silly superstition. ", "\" They represented, with patches of gold and cataracts of purple, with stiff saints and angular angels, with ugly Madonnas and uglier babies, strange prayers and prostrations; ", "so that she at first took his words for a protest against devotional idolatry-all the more that he had of late often come with her and with Mrs. Wix to morning church, a place of worship of Mrs. Wix's own choosing, where there was nothing of that sort; ", "no haloes on heads, but only, during long sermons, beguiling backs of bonnets, and where, as her governess always afterwards observed, he gave the most earnest attention. ", "It presently appeared, however, that his reference was merely to the affectation of admiring such ridiculous works-an admonition that she received from him as submissively as she received everything. ", "What turn it gave to their talk needn't here be recorded: ", "the transition to the colourless schoolroom and lonely Mrs. Wix was doubtless an effect of relaxed interest in what was before them. ", "Maisie expressed in her own way the truth that she never went home nowadays without expecting to find the temple of her studies empty and the poor priestess cast out. ", "This conveyed a full appreciation of her peril, and it was in rejoinder that Sir Claude uttered, acknowledging the source of that peril, the reassurance at which I have glanced. \" ", "Don't be afraid, my dear: ", "I've squared her. ", "\" It required indeed a supplement when he saw that it left the child momentarily blank. ", "\" I mean that your mother lets me do what I want so long as I let her do what she wants.\" ", "\"So you are doing what you want? ", "\" Maisie asked. \" ", "Rather, Miss Farange!\" ", "Miss Farange turned it over. \" ", "And she's doing the same?\" ", "\"Up to the hilt!\" ", "Again she considered. \" ", "Then, please, what may it be?\" ", "\"I wouldn't tell you for the whole world.\" ", "She gazed at a gaunt Madonna; ", "after which she broke into a slow smile. ", "\" Well, I don't care, so long as you do let her.\" ", "\"Oh you monster!\"-and Sir Claude's gay vehemence brought him to his feet. ", "Another day, in another place-a place in Baker Street where at a hungry hour she had sat down with him to tea and buns-he brought out a question disconnected from previous talk. ", "\" I say, you know, what do you suppose your father would do? ", "Maisie hadn't long to cast about or to question his pleasant eyes. ", "\" If you were really to go with us? ", "He'd make a great complaint.\" ", "He seemed amused at the term she employed. ", "\" Oh I shouldn't mind a 'complaint'!\" ", "\"He'd talk to every one about it,\" said Maisie. ", "\"Well, I shouldn't mind that either.\" ", "\"Of course not,\" the child hastened to respond. ", "\" You've told me you're not afraid of him.\" ", "\"The question is are you?\" said Sir Claude. ", "Maisie candidly considered; ", "then she spoke resolutely. ", "No, not of papa.\" ", "\"But of somebody else?\" ", "\"Certainly, of lots of people.\" ", "\"Of your mother first and foremost of course.\" ", "\"Dear, yes; ", "more of mamma than of-than of-\"  \"Than of what?\" ", "Sir Claude asked as she hesitated for a comparison. ", "She thought over all objects of dread. \" ", "Than of a wild elephant!\" ", "she at last declared. ", "\" And you are too,\" she reminded him as he laughed. ", "\"Oh yes, I am too.\" ", "Again she meditated. ", "\" Why then did you marry her?\" ", "\"Just because I was afraid.\" ", "\"Even when she loved you?\" ", "\"That made her the more alarming.\" ", "For Maisie herself, though her companion seemed to find it droll, this opened up depths of gravity. ", "\" More alarming than she is now?\" ", "\"Well, in a different way. ", "Fear, unfortunately, is a very big thing, and there's a great variety of kinds. ", "\" She took this in with complete intelligence. \" ", "Then I think I've got them all.\" ", "\"You?\" ", "her friend cried. ", "\" Nonsense! ", "You're thoroughly 'game.'\" ", "\"I'm awfully afraid of Mrs. Beale,\" Maisie objected. ", "He raised his smooth brows. ", "That charming woman?\" ", "\"Well,\" she answered, \"you can't understand it because you're not in the same state. ", "\" She had been going on with a luminous \" ", "But\" when, across the table, he laid his hand on her arm. ", "\" I can understand it,\" he confessed. ", "\" I am in the same state.\" ", "\"Oh but she likes you so! ", "Maisie promptly pleaded. ", "Sir Claude literally coloured. ", "\" That has something to do with it.\" ", "Maisie wondered again. ", "\" Being liked with being afraid?\" ", "\"Yes, when it amounts to adoration.\" ", "\"Then why aren't you afraid of me?\" ", "\"Because with you it amounts to that?\" ", "He had kept his hand on her arm. ", "\" Well, what prevents is simply that you're the gentlest spirit on earth. ", "Besides-\" he pursued; ", "but he came to a pause. ", "Besides-?\" \"I should be in fear if you were older-there! ", "See-you already make me talk nonsense,\" the young man added. ", "\" The question's about your father. ", "Is he likewise afraid of Mrs. Beale?\" ", "\"I think not. ", "And yet he loves her,\" Maisie mused. ", "Oh no-he doesn't; ", "not a bit!\" ", "After which, as his companion stared, Sir Claude apparently felt that he must make this oddity fit with her recollections. ", "\" There's nothing of that sort now.\" ", "But Maisie only stared the more. ", "\" They've changed?\" ", "\"Like your mother and me.\" ", "She wondered how he knew. ", "\" Then you've seen Mrs. Beale again?\" ", "He demurred. ", "Oh no. ", "She has written to me,\" he presently subjoined. ", "\" She's not afraid of your father either. ", "No one at all is-really.\" ", "Then he went on while Maisie's little mind, with its filial spring too relaxed from of old for a pang at this want of parental majesty, speculated on the vague relation between Mrs. Beale's courage and the question, for Mrs. Wix and herself, of a neat lodging with their friend. ", "\" She wouldn't care a bit if Mr. Farange should make a row.\" ", "\"Do you mean about you and me and Mrs. Wix? ", "Why should she care? ", "It wouldn't hurt her.\" ", "Sir Claude, with his legs out and his hand diving into his trousers-pocket, threw back his head with a laugh just perceptibly tempered, as she thought, by a sigh. ", "\" My dear stepchild, you're delightful! ", "Look here, we must pay. ", "You've had five buns?\" ", "\"How can you?\" ", "Maisie demanded, crimson under the eye of the young woman who had stepped to their board. ", "\" I've had three.\" ", "Shortly after this Mrs. Wix looked so ill that it was to be feared her ladyship had treated her to some unexampled passage. ", "Maisie asked if anything worse than usual had occurred; ", "whereupon the poor woman brought out with infinite gloom: ", "He has been seeing Mrs. Beale.\" ", "\"Sir Claude? ", "\" The child remembered what he had said. ", "\" Oh no-not seeing her!\" ", "\"I beg your pardon. ", "I absolutely know it.\" ", "Mrs. Wix was as positive as she was dismal. ", "Maisie nevertheless ventured to challenge her. \" ", "And how, please, do you know it?\" ", "She faltered a moment. ", "From herself. ", "I've been to see her.\" ", "Then on Maisie's visible surprise: ", "\"I went yesterday while you were out with him. ", "He has seen her repeatedly. ", "\" It was not wholly clear to Maisie why Mrs. Wix should be prostrate at this discovery; ", "but her general consciousness of the way things could be both perpetrated and resented always eased off for her the strain of the particular mystery. ", "\" There may be some mistake. ", "He says he hasn't.\" ", "Mrs. Wix turned paler, as if this were a still deeper ground for alarm. \" ", "He says so?-he denies that he has seen her?\" ", "\"He told me so three days ago. ", "Perhaps she's mistaken,\" Maisie suggested. ", "\"Do you mean perhaps she lies? ", "She lies whenever it suits her, I'm very sure. ", "But I know when people lie-and that's what I've loved in you, that you never do. ", "Mrs. Beale didn't yesterday at any rate. ", "He has seen her. ", "\" Maisie was silent a little. \" ", "He says not,\" she then repeated. ", "\" Perhaps-perhaps-\" Once more she paused. ", "\"Do you mean perhaps he lies?\" ", "\"Gracious goodness, no!\" ", "Maisie shouted. ", "Mrs. Wix's bitterness, however, again overflowed. ", "\" He does, he does,\" she cried, \"and it's that that's just the worst of it! ", "They'll take you, they'll take you, and what in the world will then become of me?\" ", "She threw herself afresh upon her pupil and wept over her with the inevitable effect of causing the child's own tears to flow. ", "But Maisie couldn't have told you if she had been crying at the image of their separation or at that of Sir Claude's untruth. ", "As regards this deviation it was agreed between them that they were not in a position to bring it home to him. ", "Mrs. Wix was in dread of doing anything to make him, as she said, \"worse\"; ", "and Maisie was sufficiently initiated to be able to reflect that in speaking to her as he had done he had only wished to be tender of Mrs. Beale. ", "It fell in with all her inclinations to think of him as tender, and she forbore to let him know that the two ladies had, as she would never do, betrayed him. ", "She had not long to keep her secret, for the next day, when she went out with him, he suddenly said in reference to some errand he had first proposed: ", "No, we won't do that-we'll do something else. ", "On this, a few steps from the door, he stopped a hansom and helped her in; ", "then following her he gave the driver over the top an address that she lost. ", "When he was seated beside her she asked him where they were going; ", "to which he replied \"My dear child, you'll see. ", "\" She saw while she watched and wondered that they took the direction of the Regent's Park; ", "but she didn't know why he should make a mystery of that, and it was not till they passed under a pretty arch and drew up at a white house in a terrace from which the view, she thought, must be lovely that, mystified, she clutched him and broke out: ", "I shall see papa?\" ", "He looked down at her with a kind smile. ", "No, probably not. ", "I haven't brought you for that.\" ", "\"Then whose house is it?\" ", "\"It's your father's. ", "They've moved here.\" ", "She looked about: ", "she had known Mr. Farange in four or five houses, and there was nothing astonishing in this except that it was the nicest place yet. ", "\" But I shall see Mrs. Beale?\" ", "\"It's to see her that I brought you.\" ", "She stared, very white, and, with her hand on his arm, though they had stopped, kept him sitting in the cab. \" ", "To leave me, do you mean? ", "He could scarce bring it out. ", "\" It's not for me to say if you can stay. ", "We must look into it.\" ", "\"But if I do I shall see papa?\" ", "\"Oh some time or other, no doubt. ", "\" Then Sir Claude went on: ", "Have you really so very great a dread of that? ", "Maisie glanced away over the apron of the cab-gazed a minute at the green expanse of the Regent's Park and, at this moment colouring to the roots of her hair, felt the full, hot rush of an emotion more mature than any she had yet known. ", "It consisted of an odd unexpected shame at placing in an inferior light, to so perfect a gentleman and so charming a person as Sir Claude, so very near a relative as Mr. Farange. ", "She remembered, however, her friend's telling her that no one was seriously afraid of her father, and she turned round with a small toss of her head. ", "\" Oh I dare say I can manage him!\" ", "Sir Claude smiled, but she noted that the violence with which she had just changed colour had brought into his own face a slight compunctious and embarrassed flush. ", "It was as if he had caught his first glimpse of her sense of responsibility. ", "Neither of them made a movement to get out, and after an instant he said to her: ", "\"Look here, if you say so we won't after all go in.\" ", "\"Ah but I want to see Mrs. Beale!\" ", "the child gently wailed. ", "\"But what if she does decide to take you? ", "Then, you know, you'll have to remain. ", "\" Maisie turned it over. \" ", "Straight on-and give you up?\" ", "\"Well-I don't quite know about giving me up.\" ", "\"I mean as I gave up Mrs. Beale when I last went to mamma's. ", "I couldn't do without you here for anything like so long a time as that. ", "\" It struck her as a hundred years since she had seen Mrs. Beale, who was on the other side of the door they were so near and whom she yet had not taken the jump to clasp in her arms. ", "\"Oh I dare say you'll see more of me than you've seen of Mrs. Beale. ", "It isn't in me to be so beautifully discreet,\" Sir Claude said. ", "\" But all the same,\" he continued, \"I leave the thing, now that we're here, absolutely with you. ", "You must settle it. ", "We'll only go in if you say so. ", "If you don't say so we'll turn right round and drive away.\" ", "\"So in that case Mrs. Beale won't take me?\" ", "\"Well-not by any act of ours.\" ", "\"And I shall be able to go on with mamma?\" ", "Maisie asked. ", "\"Oh I don't say that!\" ", "She considered. \" ", "But I thought you said you had squared her?\" ", "Sir Claude poked his stick at the splashboard of the cab. \" ", "Not, my dear child, to the point she now requires.\" ", "\"Then if she turns me out and I don't come here-\"  Sir Claude promptly took her up. ", "What do I offer you, you naturally enquire? ", "My poor chick, that's just what I ask myself. ", "I don't see it, I confess, quite as straight as Mrs. Wix. ", "\" His companion gazed a moment at what Mrs. Wix saw. ", "\" You mean we can't make a little family?\" ", "\"It's very base of me, no doubt, but I can't wholly chuck your mother. ", "\" Maisie, at this, emitted a low but lengthened sigh, a slight sound of reluctant assent which would certainly have been amusing to an auditor. ", "\" Then there isn't anything else?\" ", "\"I vow I don't quite see what there is. ", "\" Maisie waited; ", "her silence seemed to signify that she too had no alternative to suggest. ", "But she made another appeal. ", "\" If I come here you'll come to see me?\" ", "\"I won't lose sight of you.\" ", "\"But how often will you come?\" ", "As he hung fire she pressed him. \" ", "Often and often?\" ", "Still he faltered. ", "\" My dear old woman-\" he began. ", "Then he paused again, going on the next moment with a change of tone. ", "\" You're too funny! ", "Yes then,\" he said; ", "\"often and often.\" ", "\"All right! ", "Maisie jumped out. ", "Mrs. Beale was at home, but not in the drawing-room, and when the butler had gone for her the child suddenly broke out: ", "But when I'm here what will Mrs. Wix do?\" ", "\"Ah you should have thought of that sooner!\" said her companion with the first faint note of asperity she had ever heard him sound. ", "XIV    ", "Mrs Beale fairly swooped upon her and the effect of the whole hour was to show the child how much, how quite formidably indeed, after all, she was loved. ", "This was the more the case as her stepmother, so changed-in the very manner of her mother-that she really struck her as a new acquaintance, somehow recalled more familiarity than Maisie could feel. ", "A rich strong expressive affection in short pounced upon her in the shape of a handsomer, ampler, older Mrs. Beale. ", "It was like making a fine friend, and they hadn't been a minute together before she felt elated at the way she had met the choice imposed on her in the cab. ", "There was a whole future in the combination of Mrs. Beale's beauty and Mrs. Beale's hug. ", "She seemed to Maisie charming to behold, and also to have no connexion at all with anybody who had once mended underclothing and had meals in the nursery. ", "The child knew one of her father's wives was a woman of fashion, but she had always dimly made a distinction, not applying that epithet without reserve to the other. ", "Mrs. Beale had since their separation acquired a conspicuous right to it, and Maisie's first flush of response to her present delight coloured all her splendour with meanings that this time were sweet. ", "She had told Sir Claude she was afraid of the lady in the Regent's Park; ", "but she had confidence enough to break on the spot, into the frankest appreciation. ", "\" Why, aren't you beautiful? ", "Isn't she beautiful, Sir Claude, isn't she?\" ", "\"The handsomest woman in London, simply,\" Sir Claude gallantly replied. ", "\" Just as sure as you're the best little girl!\" ", "Well, the handsomest woman in London gave herself up, with tender lustrous looks and every demonstration of fondness, to a happiness at last clutched again. ", "There was almost as vivid a bloom in her maturity as in mamma's, and it took her but a short time to give her little friend an impression of positive power-an impression that seemed to begin like a long bright day. ", "This was a perception on Maisie's part that neither mamma, nor Sir Claude, nor Mrs. Wix, with their immense and so varied respective attractions, had exactly kindled, and that made an immediate difference when the talk, as it promptly did, began to turn to her father. ", "Oh yes, Mr. Farange was a complication, but she saw now that he wouldn't be one for his daughter. ", "For Mrs. Beale certainly he was an immense one-she speedily made known as much; ", "but Mrs. Beale from this moment presented herself to Maisie as a person to whom a great gift had come. ", "The great gift was just for handling complications. ", "Maisie felt how little she made of them when, after she had dropped to Sir Claude some recall of a previous meeting, he made answer, with a sound of consternation and yet an air of relief, that he had denied to their companion their having, since the day he came for her, seen each other till that moment. ", "Mrs. Beale could but vaguely pity it. ", "\" Why did you do anything so silly?\" ", "\"To protect your reputation.\" ", "\"From Maisie?\" ", "Mrs. Beale was much amused. ", "\" My reputation with Maisie is too good to suffer.\" ", "\"But you believed me, you rascal, didn't you?\" ", "Sir Claude asked of the child. ", "She looked at him; ", "she smiled. \" ", "Her reputation did suffer. ", "I discovered you had been here.\" ", "He was not too chagrined to laugh. ", "\" The way, my dear, you talk of that sort of thing!\" ", "\"How should she talk,\" Mrs. Beale wanted to know, \"after all this wretched time with her mother?\" ", "\"It was not mamma who told me,\" Maisie explained. ", "\" It was only Mrs. Wix. ", "\" She was hesitating whether to bring out before Sir Claude the source of Mrs. Wix's information; ", "but Mrs. Beale, addressing the young man, showed the vanity of scruples. ", "\"Do you know that preposterous person came to see me a day or two ", "ago?-when I told her I had seen you repeatedly.\" ", "Sir Claude, for once in a way, was disconcerted. ", "\" The old cat! ", "She never told me. ", "Then you thought I had lied?\" ", "he demanded of Maisie. ", "She was flurried by the term with which he had qualified her gentle friend, but she took the occasion for one to which she must in every manner lend herself. ", "\" Oh I didn't mind! ", "But Mrs. Wix did,\" she added with an intention benevolent to her governess. ", "Her intention was not very effective as regards Mrs. Beale. \" ", "Mrs. Wix is too idiotic!\" ", "that lady declared. ", "\"But to you, of all people,\" Sir Claude asked, \"what had she to say?\" ", "\"Why that, like Mrs. Micawber-whom she must, I think, rather resemble-she will never, never, never desert Miss Farange.\" ", "\"Oh I'll make that all right!\" ", "Sir Claude cheerfully returned. ", "\"I'm sure I hope so, my dear man,\" said Mrs. Beale, while Maisie wondered just how he would proceed. ", "Before she had time to ask Mrs. Beale continued: ", "That's not all she came to do, if you please. ", "But you'll never guess the rest.\" ", "\"Shall I guess it?\" ", "Maisie quavered. ", "Mrs. Beale was again amused. ", "\" Why you're just the person! ", "It must be quite the sort of thing you've heard at your awful mother's. ", "Have you never seen women there crying to her to 'spare' the men they love?\" ", "Maisie, wondering, tried to remember; ", "but Sir Claude was freshly diverted. ", "\" Oh they don't trouble about Ida! ", "Mrs. Wix cried to you to spare me?\" ", "\"She regularly went down on her knees to me.\" ", "\"The darling old dear!\" ", "the young man exclaimed. ", "These words were a joy to Maisie-they made up for his previous description of Mrs. Wix. ", "\" And will you spare him?\" ", "she asked of Mrs. Beale. ", "Her stepmother, seizing her and kissing her again, seemed charmed with the tone of her question. \" ", "Not an inch of him! ", "I'll pick him to the bone!\" ", "\"You mean that he'll really come often? ", "\" Maisie pressed. ", "Mrs. Beale turned lovely eyes to Sir Claude. ", "\" That's not for me to say-its for him.\" ", "He said nothing at once, however; ", "with his hands in his pockets and vaguely humming a tune-even Maisie could see he was a little nervous-he only walked to the window and looked out at the Regent's Park. ", "Well, he has promised,\" Maisie said. ", "\" But how will papa like it?\" ", "\"His being in and out? ", "Ah that's a question that, to be frank with you, my dear, hardly matters. ", "In point of fact, however, Beale greatly enjoys the idea that Sir Claude too, poor man, has been forced to quarrel with your mother.\" ", "Sir Claude turned round and spoke gravely and kindly. \" ", "Don't be afraid, Maisie; ", "you won't lose sight of me.\" ", "\"Thank you so much!\" ", "Maisie was radiant.

", "\" My dear old man, don't make me a scene-I assure you it's what every woman I look at does.

", "With him, however, the act had an authority transcending the wisdom of woman. ", "It all came back-the plans that always failed, all the rewards and bribes that she was perpetually paying for in advance and perpetually out of pocket by afterwards-the whole great stress to be dealt with introduced her on each occasion afresh to the question of money. ", "Even she herself almost knew how it would have expressed the strength of his empire to say that to shuffle away her sense of being duped he had only, from under his lovely moustache, to breathe upon it. ", "It was somehow in the nature of plans to be expensive and in the nature of the expensive to be impossible. ", "To be \"involved\" was of the essence of everybody's affairs, and also at every particular moment to be more involved than usual. ", "This had been the case with Sir Claude's, with papa's, with mamma's, with Mrs. Beale's and with Maisie's own at the particular moment, a moment of several weeks, that had elapsed since our young lady had been re-established at her father's. ", "There wasn't \"two-and-tuppence\" for anything or for any one, and that was why there had been no sequel to the classes in French literature with all the smart little girls. ", "It was devilish awkward, didn't she see?

", "She was to feel henceforth as if she were flattening her nose upon the hard window-pane of the sweet-shop of knowledge. ", "If the classes, however, that were select, and accordingly the only ones, were impossibly dear, the lectures at the institutions-at least at some of them-were directly addressed to the intelligent poor, and it therefore had to be easier still to produce on the spot the reason why she had been taken to none. ", "This reason, Sir Claude said, was that she happened to be just going to be, though they had nothing to do with that in now directing their steps to the banks of the Serpentine. ", "Maisie's own park, in the north, had been nearer at hand, but they rolled westward in a hansom because at the end of the sweet June days this was the direction taken by every one that any one looked at. ", "They cultivated for an hour, on the Row and by the Drive, this opportunity for each observer to amuse and for one of them indeed, not a little hilariously, to mystify the other, and before the hour was over Maisie had elicited, in reply to her sharpest challenge, a further account of her friend's long absence. ", "\"Why I've broken my word to you so dreadfully-promising so solemnly and then never coming?

", "Those were just the words Maisie had last heard him use about Mrs. Wix. ", "She clung to his hand, which was encased in a pearl-grey glove ornamented with the thick black lines that, at her mother's, always used to strike her as connected with the way the bestitched fists of the long ladies carried, with the elbows well out, their umbrellas upside down. ", "The mere sense of his grasp in her own covered the ground of loss just as much as the ground of gain. ", "His presence was like an object brought so close to her face that she couldn't see round its edges. ", "He himself, however, remained showman of the spectacle even after they had passed out of the Park and begun, under the charm of the spot and the season, to stroll in Kensington Gardens. ", "What they had left behind them was, as he said, only a pretty bad circus, and, through prepossessing gates and over a bridge, they had come in a quarter of an hour, as he also remarked, a hundred miles from London. ", "A great green glade was before them, and high old trees, and under the shade of these, in the fresh turf, the crooked course of a rural footpath. ", "\" It's the Forest of Arden,\" Sir Claude had just delightfully observed, \"and I'm the banished duke, and you're-what was the young woman called?-the artless country wench. ", "And there,\" he went on, \"is the other girl-what's her name, Rosalind?-and (don't you know?) ", "the fellow who was making up to her. ", "Upon my word he is making up to her!\" ", "His allusion was to a couple who, side by side, at the end of the glade, were moving in the same direction as themselves. ", "These distant figures, in their slow stroll (which kept them so close together that their heads, drooping a little forward, almost touched), presented the back of a lady who looked tall, who was evidently a very fine woman, and that of a gentleman whose left hand appeared to be passed well into her arm while his right, behind him, made jerky motions with the stick that it grasped. ", "Maisie's fancy responded for an instant to her friend's idea that the sight was idyllic; ", "then, stopping short, she brought out with all her clearness: ", "\"Why mercy-if it isn't mamma!\" ", "Sir Claude paused with a stare. \" ", "Mamma? ", "But mamma's at Brussels. ", "\" Maisie, with her eyes on the lady, wondered. ", "At Brussels?\" ", "\"She's gone to play a match.\" ", "\"At billiards? ", "You didn't tell me.\" ", "\"Of course I didn't!\" ", "Sir Claude ejaculated. ", "\" There's plenty I don't tell you. ", "She went on Wednesday. ", "\" The couple had added to their distance, but Maisie's eyes more than kept pace with them. \" ", "Then she has come back.\" ", "Sir Claude watched the lady. ", "\" It's much more likely she never went!\" ", "\"It's mamma!\" ", "the child said with decision. ", "They had stood still, but Sir Claude had made the most of his opportunity, and it happened that just at this moment, at the end of the vista, the others halted and, still showing only their backs, seemed to stay talking. ", "Right you are, my duck!\" ", "he exclaimed at last. ", "\" It's my own sweet wife!\" ", "He had spoken with a laugh, but he had changed colour, and Maisie quickly looked away from him. ", "\" Then who is it with her?\" ", "\"Blest if I know!\" said Sir Claude. ", "\"Is it Mr. Perriam?\" ", "\"Oh dear no-Perriam's smashed.\" ", "\"Smashed?\" \" ", "Exposed-in the City. ", "But there are quantities of others!\" ", "Sir Claude smiled. ", "Maisie appeared to count them; ", "she studied the gentleman's back. \" ", "Then is this Lord Eric? ", "\" For a moment her companion made no answer, and when she turned her eyes again to him he was looking at her, she thought, rather queerly. ", "\" What do you know about Lord Eric? ", "\" She tried innocently to be odd in return. ", "\" Oh I know more than you think! ", "Is it Lord Eric?\" ", "she repeated. ", "\"It maybe. ", "Blest if I care! ", "\" Their friends had slightly separated and now, as Sir Claude spoke, suddenly faced round, showing all the splendour of her ladyship and all the mystery of her comrade. ", "Maisie held her breath. ", "\" They're coming!\" ", "\"Let them come.\" ", "And Sir Claude, pulling out his cigarettes, began to strike a light. ", "\"We shall meet them!\" ", "\"No. ", "They'll meet us. ", "Maisie stood her ground. ", "\" They see us. ", "Just look.\" ", "Sir Claude threw away his match. ", "\" Come straight on.\" ", "The others, in the return, evidently startled, had half-paused again, keeping well apart. ", "\" She's horribly surprised and wants to slope,\" he continued. ", "\" But it's too late. ", "\" Maisie advanced beside him, making out even across the interval that her ladyship was ill at ease. ", "Then what will she do?\" ", "Sir Claude puffed his cigarette. ", "\" She's quickly thinking.\" ", "He appeared to enjoy it. ", "Ida had wavered but an instant; ", "her companion clearly gave her moral support. ", "Maisie thought he somehow looked brave, and he had no likeness whatever to Mr. Perriam. ", "His face, thin and rather sharp, was smooth, and it was not till they came nearer that she saw he had a remarkably fair little moustache. ", "She could already see that his eyes were of the lightest blue. ", "He was far nicer than Mr. Perriam. ", "Mamma looked terrible from afar, but even under her guns the child's curiosity flickered and she appealed again to Sir Claude. ", "\" Is it-is it Lord Eric?\" ", "Sir Claude smoked composedly enough. ", "\" I think it's the Count. ", "\" This was a happy solution-it fitted her idea of a count. ", "But what idea, as she now came grandly on, did mamma fit?-unless that of an actress, in some tremendous situation, sweeping down to the footlights as if she would jump them. ", "Maisie felt really so frightened that before she knew it she had passed her hand into Sir Claude's arm. ", "Her pressure caused him to stop, and at the sight of this the other couple came equally to a stand and, beyond the diminished space, remained a moment more in talk. ", "This, however, was the matter of an instant; ", "leaving the Count apparently to come round more circuitously-an outflanking movement, if Maisie had but known-her ladyship resumed the onset. ", "\" What will she do now?\" ", "her daughter asked. ", "Sir Claude was at present in a position to say: ", "Try to pretend it's me.\" ", "\"You?\" ", "\"Why that I'm up to something.\" ", "In another minute poor Ida had justified this prediction, erect there before them like a figure of justice in full dress. ", "There were parts of her face that grew whiter while Maisie looked, and other parts in which this change seemed to make other colours reign with more intensity. ", "\" What are you doing with my daughter?\" ", "she demanded of her husband; ", "in spite of the indignant tone of which Maisie had a greater sense than ever in her life before of not being personally noticed. ", "It seemed to her Sir Claude also grew pale as an effect of the loud defiance with which Ida twice repeated this question. ", "He put her, instead of answering it, an enquiry of his own: ", "\"Who the devil have you got hold of now?\" ", "and at this her ladyship turned tremendously to the child, glaring at her as at an equal plotter of sin. ", "Maisie received in petrifaction the full force of her mother's huge painted eyes-they were like Japanese lanterns swung under festal arches. ", "But life came back to her from a tone suddenly and strangely softened. ", "\" Go straight to that gentleman, my dear; ", "I've asked him to take you a few minutes. ", "He's charming-go. ", "I've something to say to this creature. ", "\" Maisie felt Sir Claude immediately clutch her. \" ", "No, no-thank you: ", "that won't do. ", "She's mine.\" ", "\"Yours?\" ", "It was confounding to Maisie to hear her speak quite as if she had never heard of Sir Claude before. ", "Mine. ", "You've given her up. ", "You've not another word to say about her. ", "I have her from her father,\" said Sir Claude-a statement that startled his companion, who could also measure its lively action on her mother. ", "There was visibly, however, an influence that made Ida consider; ", "she glanced at the gentleman she had left, who, having strolled with his hands in his pockets to some distance, stood there with unembarrassed vagueness. ", "She directed to him the face that was like an illuminated garden, turnstile and all, for the frequentation of which he had his season-ticket; ", "then she looked again at Sir Claude. ", "\" I've given her up to her father to keep-not to get rid of by sending about the town either with you or with any one else. ", "If she's not to mind me let him come and tell me so. ", "I decline to take it from another person, and I like your pretending that with your humbug of 'interest' you've a leg to stand on. ", "I know your game and have something now to say to you about it.\" ", "Sir Claude gave a squeeze of the child's arm. ", "\" Didn't I tell you she'd have, Miss Farange?\" ", "\"You're uncommonly afraid to hear it,\" Ida went on; ", "but if you think she'll protect you from it you're mightily mistaken. ", "\" She gave him a moment. ", "\" I'll give her the benefit as soon as look at you. ", "Should you like her to know, my dear? ", "\" Maisie had a sense of her launching the question with effect; ", "yet our young lady was also conscious of hoping that Sir Claude would declare that preference. ", "We have already learned that she had come to like people's liking her to \"know.\" ", "Before he could reply at all, none the less, her mother opened a pair of arms of extraordinary elegance, and then she felt the loosening of his grasp. ", "\" My own child,\" Ida murmured in a voice-a voice of sudden confused tenderness-that it seemed to her she heard for the first time. ", "She wavered but an instant, thrilled with the first direct appeal, as distinguished from the mere maternal pull, she had ever had from lips that, even in the old vociferous years, had always been sharp. ", "The next moment she was on her mother's breast, where, amid a wilderness of trinkets, she felt as if she had suddenly been thrust, with a smash of glass, into a jeweller's shop-front, but only to be as suddenly ejected with a push and the brisk injunction: ", "Now go to the Captain! ", "Maisie glanced at the gentleman submissively, but felt the want of more introduction. \" ", "The Captain?\" ", "Sir Claude broke into a laugh. ", "\" I told her it was the Count.\" ", "Ida stared; ", "she rose so superior that she was colossal. ", "\" You're too utterly loathsome,\" she then declared. \" ", "Be off!\" ", "she repeated to her daughter. ", "Maisie started, moved backward and, looking at Sir Claude, \"Only for a moment,\" she signed to him in her bewilderment. ", "But he was too angry to heed her-too angry with his wife; ", "as she turned away she heard his anger break out. ", "\" You damned old b--\"-she couldn't quite hear all. ", "It was enough, it was too much: ", "she fled before it, rushing even to a stranger for the shock of such a change of tone. ", "XVI    ", "As she met the Captain's light blue eyes the greatest marvel occurred; ", "she felt a sudden relief at finding them reply with anxiety to the horror in her face. ", "\" What in the world has he done?\" ", "He put it all on Sir Claude. ", "\"He has called her a damned old brute. ", "\" She couldn't help bringing that out. ", "The Captain, at the same elevation as her ladyship, gaped wide; ", "then of course, like every one else, he was convulsed. ", "But he instantly caught himself up, echoing her bad words. ", "A damned old brute-your mother? ", "\" Maisie was already conscious of her second movement. ", "\" I think she tried to make him angry.\" ", "The Captain's stupefaction was fine. ", "Angry-she? ", "Why she's an angel! ", "On the spot, as he said this, his face won her over; ", "it was so bright and kind, and his blue eyes had such a reflexion of some mysterious grace that, for him at least, her mother had put forth. ", "Her fund of observation enabled her as she gazed up at him to place him: ", "he was a candid simple soldier; ", "very grave-she came back to that-but not at all terrible. ", "At any rate he struck a note that was new to her and that after a moment made her say: ", "Do you like her very much?\" ", "He smiled down at her, hesitating, looking pleasanter and pleasanter. ", "\" Let me tell you about your mother.\" ", "He put out a big military hand which she immediately took, and they turned off together to where a couple of chairs had been placed under one of the trees. \" ", "She told me to come to you,\" Maisie explained as they went; ", "and presently she was close to him in a chair, with the prettiest of pictures-the sheen of the lake through other trees-before them, and the sound of birds, the plash of boats, the play of children in the air. ", "The Captain, inclining his military person, sat sideways to be closer and kinder, and as her hand was on the arm of her seat he put his own down on it again to emphasise something he had to say that would be good for her to hear. ", "He had already told her how her mother, from the moment of seeing her so unexpectedly with a person who was-well, not at all the right person, had promptly asked him to take charge of her while she herself tackled, as she said, the real culprit. ", "He gave the child the sense of doing for the time what he liked with her; ", "ten minutes before she had never seen him, but she could now sit there touching him, touched and impressed by him and thinking it nice when a gentleman was thin and brown-brown with a kind of clear depth that made his straw-coloured moustache almost white and his eyes resemble little pale flowers. ", "The most extraordinary thing was the way she didn't appear just then to mind Sir Claude's being tackled. ", "The Captain wasn't a bit like him, for it was an odd part of the pleasantness of mamma's friend that it resided in a manner in this friend's having a face so informally put together that the only kindness could be to call it funny. ", "An odder part still was that it finally made our young lady, to classify him further, say to herself that, of all people in the world, he reminded her most insidiously of Mrs. Wix.

", "What he had to say to her that was good for her to hear was that her poor mother (didn't she know?) was the best friend he had ever had in all his life. ", "And he added: ", "She has told me ever so much about you. ", "I'm awfully glad to know you. ", "\" She had never, she thought, been so addressed as a young lady, not even by Sir Claude the day, so long ago, that she found him with Mrs. Beale.

", "But this effort flurried her, and all she could produce was: ", "At first, you know, I thought you were Lord Eric.

", "What-do-you-call-him's brother, the fellow that owned Bobolink?

", "\" And doesn't she know the Count?\" ", "\"Oh I dare say! ", "But he's another ass.\" ", "After which abruptly, with a different look, he put down again on the back of her own the hand he had momentarily removed. ", "Maisie even thought he coloured a little. ", "\" I want tremendously to speak to you. ", "You must never believe any harm of your mother.\" ", "\"Oh I assure you I don't!\" cried the child, blushing, herself, up to her eyes in a sudden surge of deprecation of such a thought. ", "The Captain, bending his head, raised her hand to his lips with a benevolence that made her wish her glove had been nicer. \" ", "Of course you don't when you know how fond she is of you.\" ", "\"She's fond of me?\" ", "Maisie panted. \" ", "Tremendously. ", "But she thinks you don't like her. ", "You must like her. ", "She has had too much to put up with.\" ", "\"Oh yes-I know!\" ", "She rejoiced that she had never denied it. \" ", "Of course I've no right to speak of her except as a particular friend,\" the Captain went on. \" ", "But she's a splendid woman. ", "She has never had any sort of justice.\" ", "\"Hasn't she?\"-his companion, to hear the words, felt a thrill altogether new. \" ", "Perhaps I oughtn't to say it to you, but she has had everything to suffer.\" ", "\"Oh yes-you can say it to me!\" ", "Maisie hastened to profess. ", "The Captain was glad. ", "\" Well, you needn't tell. ", "It's all for you-do you see?\" ", "Serious and smiling she only wanted to take it from him. ", "\" It's between you and me!

", "She'll go through anything for any one she likes.\" ", "He appeared to watch for a moment the effect on his companion of this emphasis; ", "then he gave a small sigh that mourned the limits of the speakable. ", "But it was almost with the note of a fresh challenge that he wound up: ", "Look here, she's true! ", "Maisie had so little desire to assert the contrary that she found herself, in the intensity of her response, throbbing with a joy still less utterable than the essence of the Captain's admiration. ", "She was fairly hushed with the sense that he spoke of her mother as she had never heard any one speak. ", "It came over her as she sat silent that, after all, this admiration and this respect were quite new words, which took a distinction from the fact that nothing in the least resembling them in quality had on any occasion dropped from the lips of her father, of Mrs. Beale, of Sir Claude or even of Mrs. Wix. ", "What it appeared to her to come to was that on the subject of her ladyship it was the first real kindness she had heard, so that at the touch of it something strange and deep and pitying surged up within her-a revelation that, practically and so far as she knew, her mother, apart from this, had only been disliked. ", "Mrs. Wix's original account of Sir Claude's affection seemed as empty now as the chorus in a children's game, and the husband and wife, but a little way off at that moment, were face to face in hatred and with the dreadful name he had called her still in the air. ", "What was it the Captain on the other hand had called her? ", "Maisie wanted to hear that again. ", "The tears filled her eyes and rolled down her cheeks, which burned under them with the rush of a consciousness that for her too, five minutes before, the vivid towering beauty whose assault she awaited had been, a moment long, an object of pure dread. ", "She became on the spot indifferent to her usual fear of showing what in children was notoriously most offensive-presented to her companion, soundlessly but hideously, her wet distorted face. ", "She cried, with a pang, straight at him, cried as she had never cried at any one in all her life. ", "Oh do you love her?\" ", "she brought out with a gulp that was the effect of her trying not to make a noise. ", "It was doubtless another consequence of the thick mist through which she saw him that in reply to her question the Captain gave her such a queer blurred look. ", "He stammered, yet in his voice there was also the ring of a great awkward insistence. \" ", "Of course I'm tremendously fond of her-I like her better than any woman I ever saw. ", "I don't mind in the least telling you that,\" he went on, \"and I should think myself a great beast if I did. ", "\" Then to show that his position was superlatively clear he made her, with a kindness that even Sir Claude had never surpassed, tremble again as she had trembled at his first outbreak. ", "He called her by her name, and her name drove it home. ", "\" My dear Maisie, your mother's an angel! ", "\" It was an almost unbelievable balm-it soothed so her impression of danger and pain. ", "She sank back in her chair, she covered her face with her hands. \" ", "Oh mother, mother, mother! ", "she sobbed. ", "She had an impression that the Captain, beside her, if more and more friendly, was by no means unembarrassed; ", "in a minute, however, when her eyes were clearer, he was erect in front of her, very red and nervously looking about him and whacking his leg with his stick. ", "Say you love her, Mr. Captain; ", "say it, say it!\" ", "she implored. ", "Mr. Captain's blue eyes fixed themselves very hard. \" ", "Of course I love her, damn it, you know! ", "At this she also jumped up; ", "she had fished out somehow her pocket-handkerchief. \" ", "So do I then. ", "I do, I do, I do!\" ", "she passionately asseverated. ", "\"Then will you come back to her?\" ", "Maisie, staring, stopped the tight little plug of her handkerchief on the way to her eyes. ", "\" She won't have me.\" ", "\"Yes she will. ", "She wants you.\" ", "\"Back at the house-with Sir Claude?\" ", "Again he hung fire. \" ", "No, not with him. ", "In another place. ", "\" They stood looking at each other with an intensity unusual as between a Captain and a little girl. ", "\" She won't have me in any place.\" ", "\"Oh yes she will if I ask her! ", "Maisie's intensity continued. ", "\" Shall you be there?\" ", "The Captain's, on the whole, did the same. ", "Oh yes-some day.\" ", "\"Then you don't mean now?\" ", "He broke into a quick smile. ", "Will you come now?-go with us for an hour? ", "\" Maisie considered. ", "\" She wouldn't have me even now.\" ", "She could see that he had his idea, but that her tone impressed him. ", "That disappointed her a little, though in an instant he rang out again. ", "She will if I ask her,\" he repeated. ", "\" I'll ask her this minute. ", "\" Maisie, turning at this, looked away to where her mother and her stepfather had stopped. ", "At first, among the trees, nobody was visible; ", "but the next moment she exclaimed with expression: ", "It's over-here he comes!\" ", "The Captain watched the approach of her ladyship's husband, who lounged composedly over the grass, making to Maisie with his closed fingers a little movement in the air. ", "\" I've no desire to avoid him.\" ", "\"Well, you mustn't see him,\" said Maisie. ", "\"Oh he's in no hurry himself!\" ", "Sir Claude had stopped to light another cigarette. ", "She was vague as to the way it was proper he should feel; ", "but she had a sense that the Captain's remark was rather a free reflexion on it. ", "\" Oh he doesn't care!\" ", "she replied. \" ", "Doesn't care for what?\" ", "\"Doesn't care who you are. ", "He told me so. ", "Go and ask mamma,\" she added. ", "\"If you can come with us? ", "Very good. ", "You really want me not to wait for him?\" ", "\"Please don't.\" ", "But Sir Claude was not yet near, and the Captain had with his left hand taken hold of her right, which he familiarly, sociably swung a little. ", "\" Only first,\" she continued, \"tell me this. ", "Are you going to live with mamma? ", "\" The immemorial note of mirth broke out at her seriousness. ", "One of these days. ", "\" She wondered, wholly unperturbed by his laughter. \" ", "Then where will Sir Claude be?\" ", "\"He'll have left her of course.\" ", "\"Does he really intend to do that?\" ", "\"You've every opportunity to ask him. ", "\" Maisie shook her head with decision. \" ", "He won't do it. ", "Not first. ", "Her \"first\" made the Captain laugh out again. ", "\" Oh he'll be sure to be nasty! ", "But I've said too much to you.\" ", "\"Well, you know, I'll never tell,\" said Maisie. ", "No, it's all for yourself. ", "Good-bye.\" ", "\"Good-bye. ", "Maisie kept his hand long enough to add: ", "\"I like you too.\" ", "And then supremely: ", "You do love her?\" ", "\"My dear child-!\" ", "The Captain wanted words. \" ", "Then don't do it only for just a little.\" ", "\"A little?\" ", "\"Like all the others.\" ", "\"All the others?\"-he stood staring. ", "She pulled away her hand. ", "Do it always!\" ", "She bounded to meet Sir Claude, and as she left the Captain she heard him ring out with apparent gaiety: ", " \"Oh I'm in for it!\" ", "As she joined Sir Claude she noted her mother in the distance move slowly off, and, glancing again at the Captain, saw him, swinging his stick, retreat in the same direction. ", "She had never seen Sir Claude look as he looked just then; ", "flushed yet not excited-settled rather in an immoveable disgust and at once very sick and very hard. ", "His conversation with her mother had clearly drawn blood, and the child's old horror came back to her, begetting the instant moral contraction of the days when her parents had looked to her to feed their love of battle. ", "Her greatest fear for the moment, however, was that her friend would see she had been crying. ", "The next she became aware that he had glanced at her, and it presently occurred to her that he didn't even wish to be looked at. ", "At this she quickly removed her gaze, while he said rather curtly: ", "Well, who in the world is the fellow?\" ", "She felt herself flooded with prudence. ", "\" Oh I haven't found out!\" ", "This sounded as if she meant he ought to have done so himself; ", "but she could only face doggedly the ugliness of seeming disagreeable, as she used to face it in the hours when her father, for her blankness, called her a dirty little donkey, and her mother, for her falsity, pushed her out of the room. ", "\"Then what have you been doing all this time?\" ", "\"Oh I don't know! ", "\" It was of the essence of her method not to be silly by halves. \" ", "Then didn't the beast say anything?\" ", "They had got down by the lake and were walking fast. \" ", "Well, not very much.\" ", "\"He didn't speak of your mother?\" ", "\"Oh yes, a little!\" ", "\"Then what I ask you, please, is how?\" ", "She kept silence-so long that he presently went on: ", "I say, you know-don't you hear me?\" ", "At this she produced: ", "Well, I'm afraid I didn't attend to him very much.\" ", "Sir Claude, smoking rather hard, made no immediate rejoinder; ", "but finally he exclaimed: ", "Then my dear-with such a chance-you were the perfection of a dunce!\" ", "He was so irritated-or she took him to be-that for the rest of the time they were in the Gardens he spoke no other word; ", "and she meanwhile subtly abstained from any attempt to pacify him. ", "That would only lead to more questions. ", "At the gate of the Gardens he hailed a four-wheeled cab and, in silence, without meeting her eyes, put her into it, only saying \"Give him that\" as he tossed half a crown upon the seat. ", "Even when from outside he had closed the door and told the man where to go he never took her departing look. ", "Nothing of this kind had ever yet happened to them, but it had no power to make her love him less; ", "so she could not only bear it, she felt as she drove away-she could rejoice in it. ", "It brought again the sweet sense of success that, ages before, she had had at a crisis when, on the stairs, returning from her father's, she had met a fierce question of her mother's with an imbecility as deep and had in consequence been dashed by Mrs. Farange almost to the bottom. ", "XVII    ", "If for reasons of her own she could bear the sense of Sir Claude's displeasure her young endurance might have been put to a serious test. ", "The days went by without his knocking at her father's door, and the time would have turned sadly to waste if something hadn't conspicuously happened to give it a new difference. ", "What took place was a marked change in the attitude of Mrs. Beale-a change that somehow, even in his absence, seemed to bring Sir Claude again into the house. ", "It began practically with a conversation that occurred between them the day Maisie, came home alone in the cab. ", "Mrs. Beale had by that time returned, and she was more successful than their friend in extracting from our young lady an account of the extraordinary passage with the Captain. ", "She came back to it repeatedly, and on the very next day it grew distinct to the child that she was already in full possession of what at the same moment had been enacted between her ladyship and Sir Claude. ", "This was the real origin of her final perception that though he didn't come to the house her stepmother had some rare secret for not being quite without him. ", "This led to some rare passages with Mrs. Beale, the promptest of which had been-not on Maisie's part-a wonderful outbreak of tears. ", "Mrs. Beale was not, as she herself said, a crying creature: ", "she hadn't cried, to Maisie's knowledge, since the lowly governess days, the grey dawn of their connexion. ", "But she wept now with passion, professing loudly that it did her good and saying remarkable things to her charge, for whom the occasion was an equal benefit, an addition to all the fine precautionary wisdom stored away. ", "It somehow hadn't violated that wisdom, Maisie felt, for her to have told Mrs. Beale what she had not told Sir Claude, inasmuch as the greatest strain, to her sense, was between Sir Claude and Sir Claude's wife, and his wife was just what Mrs. Beale was unfortunately not. ", "He sent his stepdaughter three days after the incident in Kensington Gardens a message as frank as it was tender, and that was how Mrs. Beale had had to bring out in a manner that seemed half an appeal, half a defiance: ", "Well yes, hang it-I do see him!\" ", "How and when and where, however, were just what Maisie was not to know-an exclusion moreover that she never questioned in the light of a participation large enough to make him, while she shared the ample void of Mrs. Beale's rather blank independence, shine in her yearning eye like the single, the sovereign window-square of a great dim disproportioned room. ", "As far as her father was concerned such hours had no interruption; ", "and then it was clear between them that each was thinking of the absent and thinking the other thought, so that he was an object of conscious reference in everything they said or did. ", "The wretched truth, Mrs. Beale had to confess, was that she had hoped against hope and that in the Regent's Park it was impossible Sir Claude should really be in and out. ", "Hadn't they at last to look the fact in the face?-it was too disgustingly evident that no one after all had been squared. ", "Well, if no one had been squared it was because every one had been vile. ", "No one and every one were of course Beale and Ida, the extent of whose power to be nasty was a thing that, to a little girl, Mrs. Beale simply couldn't give chapter and verse for. ", "Therefore it was that to keep going at all, as she said, that lady had to make, as she also said, another arrangement-the arrangement in which Maisie was included only to the point of knowing it existed and wondering wistfully what it was. ", "Conspicuously at any rate it had a side that was responsible for Mrs. Beale's sudden emotion and sudden confidence-a demonstration this, however, of which the tearfulness was far from deterrent to our heroine's thought of how happy she should be if she could only make an arrangement for herself. ", "Mrs. Beale's own operated, it appeared, with regularity and frequency; ", "for it was almost every day or two that she was able to bring Maisie a message and to take one back. ", "It had been over the vision of what, as she called it, he did for her that she broke down; ", "and this vision was kept in a manner before Maisie by a subsequent increase not only of the gaiety, but literally-it seemed not presumptuous to perceive-of the actual virtue of her friend. ", "The friend was herself the first to proclaim it: ", "he had pulled her up immensely-he had quite pulled her round. ", "She had charming tormenting words about him: ", "he was her good fairy, her hidden spring-above all he was just her \"higher\" conscience. ", "That was what had particularly come out with her startling tears: ", "he had made her, dear man, think ever so much better of herself. ", "It had been thus rather surprisingly revealed that she had been in a way to think ill, and Maisie was glad to hear of the corrective at the same time that she heard of the ailment. ", "She presently found herself supposing, and in spite of her envy even hoping, that whenever Mrs. Beale was out of the house Sir Claude had in some manner the satisfaction of it. ", "This was now of more frequent occurrence than ever before-so much so that she would have thought of her stepmother as almost extravagantly absent had it not been that, in the first place, her father was a superior specimen of that habit: ", "it was the frequent remark of his present wife, as it had been, before the tribunals of their country, a prominent plea of her predecessor, that he scarce came home even to sleep. ", "In the second place Mrs. Beale, when she was on the spot, had now a beautiful air of longing to make up for everything. ", "The only shadow in such bright intervals was that, as Maisie put it to herself, she could get nothing by questions. ", "It was in the nature of things to be none of a small child's business, even when a small child had from the first been deluded into a fear that she might be only too much initiated. ", "Things then were in Maisie's experience so true to their nature that questions were almost always improper; ", "but she learned on the other hand soon to recognise how at last, sometimes, patient little silences and intelligent little looks could be rewarded by delightful little glimpses. ", "There had been years at Beale Farange's when the monosyllable \"he\" meant always, meant almost violently, the master; ", "but all that was changed at a period at which Sir Claude's merits were of themselves so much in the air that it scarce took even two letters to name him. \" ", "He keeps me up splendidly-he does, my own precious,\" Mrs. Beale would observe to her comrade; ", "or else she would say that the situation at the other establishment had reached a point that could scarcely be believed-the point, monstrous as it sounded, of his not having laid eyes upon her for twelve days. ", "She\" of course at Beale Farange's had never meant any one but Ida, and there was the difference in this case that it now meant Ida with renewed intensity. ", "Mrs. Beale-it was striking-was in a position to animadvert more and more upon her dreadfulness, the moral of all which appeared to be how abominably yet blessedly little she had to do with her husband. ", "This flow of information came home to our two friends because, truly, Mrs. Beale had not much more to do with her own; ", "but that was one of the reflexions that Maisie could make without allowing it to break the spell of her present sympathy. ", "How could such a spell be anything but deep when Sir Claude's influence, operating from afar, at last really determined the resumption of his stepdaughter's studies? ", "Mrs. Beale again took fire about them and was quite vivid for Maisie as to their being the great matter to which the dear absent one kept her up. ", "This was the second source-I have just alluded to the first-of the child's consciousness of something that, very hopefully, she described to herself as a new phase; ", "and it also presented in the brightest light the fresh enthusiasm with which Mrs. Beale always reappeared and which really gave Maisie a happier sense than she had yet had of being very dear at least to two persons. ", "That she had small remembrance at present of a third illustrates, I am afraid, a temporary oblivion of Mrs. Wix, an accident to be explained only by a state of unnatural excitement. ", "For what was the form taken by Mrs. Beale's enthusiasm and acquiring relief in the domestic conditions still left to her ", "but the delightful form of \"reading\" with her little charge on lines directly prescribed and in works profusely supplied by Sir Claude? ", "He had got hold of an awfully good list-\"mostly essays, don't you know?\" ", "Mrs. Beale had said; ", "a word always august to Maisie, but henceforth to be softened by hazy, in fact by quite languorous edges. ", "There was at any rate a week in which no less than nine volumes arrived, and the impression was to be gathered from Mrs. Beale that the obscure intercourse she enjoyed with Sir Claude not only involved an account and a criticism of studies, but was organised almost for the very purpose of report and consultation. ", "It was for Maisie's education in short that, as she often repeated, she closed her door-closed it to the gentlemen who used to flock there in such numbers and whom her husband's practical desertion of her would have made it a course of the highest indelicacy to receive. ", "Maisie was familiar from of old with the principle at least of the care that a woman, as Mrs. Beale phrased it, attractive and exposed must take of her \"character,\" and was duly impressed with the rigour of her stepmother's scruples. ", "There was literally no one of the other sex whom she seemed to feel at liberty to see at home, and when the child risked an enquiry about the ladies who, one by one, during her own previous period, had been made quite loudly welcome, Mrs. Beale hastened to inform her that, one by one, they had, the fiends, been found out, after all, to be awful. ", "If she wished to know more about them she was recommended to approach her father. ", "Maisie had, however, at the very moment of this injunction much livelier curiosities, for the dream of lectures at an institution had at last become a reality, thanks to Sir Claude's now unbounded energy in discovering what could be done. ", "It stood out in this connexion that when you came to look into things in a spirit of earnestness an immense deal could be done for very little more than your fare in the Underground. ", "The institution-there was a splendid one in a part of the town but little known to the child-became, in the glow of such a spirit, a thrilling place, and the walk to it from the station through Glower Street (a pronunciation for which Mrs. Beale once laughed at her little friend) a pathway literally strewn with \"subjects. ", "\" Maisie imagined herself to pluck them as she went, though they thickened in the great grey rooms where the fountain of knowledge, in the form usually of a high voice that she took at first to be angry, plashed in the stillness of rows of faces thrust out like empty jugs. ", "\" It must do us good-it's all so hideous,\" Mrs. Beale had immediately declared; ", "manifesting a purity of resolution that made these occasions quite the most harmonious of all the many on which the pair had pulled together. ", "Maisie certainly had never, in such an association, felt so uplifted, and never above all been so carried off her feet, as at the moments of Mrs. Beale's breathlessly re-entering the house and fairly shrieking upstairs to know if they should still be in time for a lecture. ", "Her stepdaughter, all ready from the earliest hours, almost leaped over the banister to respond, and they dashed out together in quest of learning as hard as they often dashed back to release Mrs. Beale for other preoccupations. ", "There had been in short no bustle like these particular spasms, once they had broken out, since that last brief flurry when Mrs. Wix, blowing as if she were grooming her, \"made up\" for everything previously lost at her father's. ", "These weeks as well were too few, but they were flooded with a new emotion, part of which indeed came from the possibility that, through the long telescope of Glower Street, or perhaps between the pillars of the institution-which impressive objects were what Maisie thought most made it one-they should some day spy Sir Claude. ", "That was what Mrs. Beale, under pressure, had said-doubtless a little impatiently: ", "Oh yes, oh yes, some day!\" ", "His joining them was clearly far less of a matter of course than was to have been gathered from his original profession of desire to improve in their company his own mind; ", "and this sharpened our young lady's guess that since that occasion either something destructive had happened or something desirable hadn't. ", "Mrs. Beale had thrown but a partial light in telling her how it had turned out that nobody had been squared. ", "Maisie wished at any rate that somebody would be squared. ", "However, though in every approach to the temple of knowledge she watched in vain for Sir Claude, there was no doubt about the action of his loved image as an incentive and a recompense. ", "When the institution was most on pillars-or, as Mrs. Beale put it, on stilts-when the subject was deepest and the lecture longest and the listeners ugliest, then it was they both felt their patron in the background would be most pleased with them. ", "One day, abruptly, with a glance at this background, Mrs. Beale said to her companion: ", "We'll go to-night to the thingumbob at Earl's Court\"; ", "an announcement putting forth its full lustre when she had made known that she referred to the great Exhibition just opened in that quarter, a collection of extraordinary foreign things in tremendous gardens, with illuminations, bands, elephants, switchbacks and side-shows, as well as crowds of people among whom they might possibly see some one they knew. ", "Maisie flew in the same bound at the neck of her friend and at the name of Sir Claude, on which Mrs. Beale confessed that-well, yes, there was just a chance that he would be able to meet them. ", "He never of course, in his terrible position, knew what might happen from hour to hour; ", "but he hoped to be free and he had given Mrs. Beale the tip. ", "\" Bring her there on the quiet and I'll try to turn up\"-this was clear enough on what so many weeks of privation had made of his desire to see the child: ", "it even appeared to represent on his part a yearning as constant as her own. ", "That in turn was just puzzling enough to make Maisie express a bewilderment. ", "She couldn't see, if they were so intensely of the same mind, why the theory on which she had come back to Mrs. Beale, the general reunion, the delightful trio, should have broken down so in fact. ", "Mrs. Beale furthermore only gave her more to think about in saying that their disappointment was the result of his having got into his head a kind of idea. ", "\"What kind of idea?\" ", "\"Oh goodness knows!\" ", "She spoke with an approach to asperity. ", "He's so awfully delicate.\" ", "\"Delicate?\"-that was ambiguous. \" ", "About what he does, don't you know?\" said Mrs. Beale. ", "She fumbled. ", "Well, about what we do. ", "\" Maisie wondered. ", "You and me?\" ", "\"Me and him, silly!\" cried Mrs. Beale with, this time, a real giggle. ", "\"But you don't do any harm-you don't,\" said Maisie, wondering afresh and intending her emphasis as a decorous allusion to her parents. ", "\"Of course we don't, you angel-that's just the ground I take!\" ", "her companion exultantly responded. \" ", "He says he doesn't want you mixed up.\" ", "\"Mixed up with what?\" ", "\"That's exactly what I want to know: ", "mixed up with what, and how you are any more mixed-?\" ", "Mrs. Beale paused without ending her question. ", "She ended after an instant in a different way. ", "\" All you can say is that it's his fancy.\" ", "The tone of this, in spite of its expressing a resignation, the fruit of weariness, that dismissed the subject, conveyed so vividly how much such a fancy was not Mrs. Beale's own that our young lady was led by the mere fact of contact to arrive at a dim apprehension of the unuttered and the unknown. ", "The relation between her step-parents had then a mysterious residuum; ", "this was the first time she really had reflected that except as regards herself it was not a relationship. ", "To each other it was only what they might have happened to make it, and she gathered that this, in the event, had been something that led Sir Claude to keep away from her. ", "Didn't he fear she would be compromised? ", "The perception of such a scruple endeared him the more, and it flashed over her that she might simplify everything by showing him how little she made of such a danger. ", "Hadn't she lived with her eyes on it from her third year? ", "It was the condition most frequently discussed at the Faranges', where the word was always in the air and where at the age of five, amid rounds of applause, she could gabble it off. ", "She knew as well in short that a person could be compromised as that a person could be slapped with a hair-brush or left alone in the dark, and it was equally familiar to her that each of these ordeals was in general held to have too little effect. ", "But the first thing was to make absolutely sure of Mrs. Beale. ", "This was done by saying to her thoughtfully: ", "Well, if you don't mind-and you really don't, do you?\" ", "Mrs. Beale, with a dawn of amusement, considered. \" ", "Mixing you up? ", "Not a bit. ", "For what does it mean?\" ", "\"Whatever it means I don't in the least mind being mixed. ", "Therefore if you don't and I don't,\" Maisie concluded, \"don't you think that when I see him this evening I had better just tell him we don't and ask him why in the world he should?\" ", "XVIII    ", "The child, however, was not destined to enjoy much of Sir Claude at the \"thingumbob,\" which took for them a very different turn indeed. ", "On the spot Mrs. Beale, with hilarity, had urged her to the course proposed; ", "but later, at the Exhibition, she withdrew this allowance, mentioning as a result of second thoughts that when a man was so sensitive anything at all frisky usually made him worse. ", "It would have been hard indeed for Sir Claude to be \"worse,\" Maisie felt, as, in the gardens and the crowd, when the first dazzle had dropped, she looked for him in vain up and down. ", "They had all their time, the couple, for frugal wistful wandering: ", "they had partaken together at home of the light vague meal-Maisie's name for it was a \"jam-supper\"-to which they were reduced when Mr. Farange sought his pleasure abroad. ", "It was abroad now entirely that Mr. Farange pursued this ideal, and it was the actual impression of his daughter, derived from his wife, that he had three days before joined a friend's yacht at Cowes. ", "The place was full of side-shows, to which Mrs. Beale could introduce the little girl only, alas, by revealing to her so attractive, so enthralling a name: ", "the side-shows, each time, were sixpence apiece, and the fond allegiance enjoyed by the elder of our pair had been established from the earliest time in spite of a paucity of sixpences. ", "Small coin dropped from her as half-heartedly as answers from bad children to lessons that had not been looked at. ", "Maisie passed more slowly the great painted posters, pressing with a linked arm closer to her friend's pocket, where she hoped for the audible chink of a shilling. ", "But the upshot of this was but to deepen her yearning: ", "if Sir Claude would only at last come the shillings would begin to ring. ", "The companions paused, for want of one, before the Flowers of the Forest, a large presentment of bright brown ladies-they were brown all over-in a medium suggestive of tropical luxuriance, and there Maisie dolorously expressed her belief that he would never come at all. ", "Mrs. Beale hereupon, though discernibly disappointed, reminded her that he had not been promised as a certainty-a remark that caused the child to gaze at the Flowers through a blur in which they became more magnificent, yet oddly more confused, and by which moreover confusion was imparted to the aspect of a gentleman who at that moment, in the company of a lady, came out of the brilliant booth. ", "The lady was so brown that Maisie at first took her for one of the Flowers; ", "but during the few seconds that this required-a few seconds in which she had also desolately given up Sir Claude-she heard Mrs. Beale's voice, behind her, gather both wonder and pain into a single sharp little cry. \" ", "Of all the wickedness-Beale!\" ", "He had already, without distinguishing them in the mass of strollers, turned another way-it seemed at the brown lady's suggestion. ", "Her course was marked, over heads and shoulders, by an upright scarlet plume, as to the ownership of which Maisie was instantly eager. ", "\" Who is she-who is she?\" ", "But Mrs. Beale for a moment only looked after them. ", "\" The liar-the liar!\" ", "Maisie considered. \" ", "Because he's not-where one thought? ", "\" That was also, a month ago in Kensington Gardens, where her mother had not been. ", "Perhaps he has come back,\" she was quick to contribute. ", "He never went-the hound!\" ", "That, according to Sir Claude, had been also what her mother had not done, and Maisie could only have a sense of something that in a maturer mind would be called the way history repeats itself. ", "\"Who is she?\" ", "she asked again. ", "Mrs. Beale, fixed to the spot, seemed lost in the vision of an opportunity missed. ", "\" If he had only seen me!\"-it came from between her teeth. ", "\" She's a brand-new one. ", "But he must have been with her since Tuesday. ", "\" Maisie took it in. ", "She's almost black,\" she then reported. ", "\"They're always hideous,\" said Mrs. Beale. ", "This was a remark on which the child had again to reflect. ", "\" Oh not his wives! ", "\" she remonstrantly exclaimed. ", "The words at another moment would probably have set her friend \"off,\" but Mrs. Beale was now, in her instant vigilance, too immensely \"on.\" ", "\" Did you ever in your life see such a feather? ", "\" Maisie presently continued. ", "This decoration appeared to have paused at some distance, and in spite of intervening groups they could both look at it. ", "\" Oh that's the way they dress-the vulgarest of the vulgar!\" ", "\"They're coming back-they'll see us!\" ", "Maisie the next moment cried; ", "and while her companion answered that this was exactly what she wanted and the child returned \"Here they are-here they are! ", "\" the unconscious subjects of so much attention, with a change of mind about their direction, quickly retraced their steps and precipitated themselves upon their critics. ", "Their unconsciousness gave Mrs. Beale time to leap, under her breath, to a recognition which Maisie caught. ", "\"It must be Mrs. Cuddon! ", "\" Maisie looked at Mrs. Cuddon hard-her lips even echoed the name. ", "What followed was extraordinarily rapid-a minute of livelier battle than had ever yet, in so short a span at least, been waged round our heroine. ", "The muffled shock-lest people should notice-was violent, and it was only for her later thought that the steps fell into their order, the steps through which, in a bewilderment not so much of sound as of silence, she had come to find herself, too soon for comprehension and too strangely for fear, at the door of the Exhibition with her father. ", "He thrust her into a hansom and got in after her, and then it was-as she drove along with him-that she recovered a little what had happened. ", "Face to face with them in the gardens he had seen them, and there had been a moment of checked concussion during which, in a glare of black eyes and a toss of red plumage, Mrs. Cuddon had recognised them, ejaculated and vanished. ", "There had been another moment at which she became aware of Sir Claude, also poised there in surprise, but out of her father's view, as if he had been warned off at the very moment of reaching them. ", "It fell into its place with all the rest that she had heard Mrs. Beale say to her father, but whether low or loud was now lost to her, something about his having this time a new one; ", "on which he had growled something indistinct but apparently in the tone and of the sort that the child, from her earliest years, had associated with hearing somebody retort to somebody that somebody was \"another.\" ", "\" Oh I stick to the old!\" ", "Mrs. Beale had then quite loudly pronounced; ", "and her accent, even as the cab got away, was still in the air, Maisie's effective companion having spoken no other word from the moment of whisking her off-none at least save the indistinguishable address which, over the top of the hansom and poised on the step, he had given the driver. ", "Reconstructing these things later Maisie theorised that she at this point would have put a question to him had not the silence into which he charmed her or scared her-she could scarcely tell which-come from his suddenly making her feel his arm about her, feel, as he drew her close, that he was agitated in a way he had never yet shown her. ", "It struck her he trembled, trembled too much to speak, and this had the effect of making her, with an emotion which, though it had begun to throb in an instant, was by no means all dread, conform to his portentous hush. ", "The act of possession that his pressure in a manner advertised came back to her after the longest of the long intermissions that had ever let anything come back. ", "They drove and drove, and he kept her close; ", "she stared straight before her, holding her breath, watching one dark street succeed another and strangely conscious that what it all meant was somehow that papa was less to be left out of everything than she had supposed. ", "It took her but a minute to surrender to this discovery, which, in the form of his present embrace, suggested a purpose in him prodigiously reaffirmed and with that a confused confidence. ", "She neither knew exactly what he had done nor what he was doing; ", "she could only, altogether impressed and rather proud, vibrate with the sense that he had jumped up to do something and that she had as quickly become a part of it. ", "It was a part of it too that here they were at a house that seemed not large, but in the fresh white front of which the street-lamp showed a smartness of flower-boxes. ", "The child had been in thousands of stories-all Mrs. Wix's and her own, to say nothing of the richest romances of French Elise-but she had never been in such a story as this. ", "By the time he had helped her out of the cab, which drove away, and she heard in the door of the house the prompt little click of his key, the Arabian Nights had quite closed round her. ", "From this minute that pitch of the wondrous was in everything, particularly in such an instant \"Open Sesame\" and in the departure of the cab, a rattling void filled with relinquished step-parents; ", "it was, with the vividness, the almost blinding whiteness of the light that sprang responsive to papa's quick touch of a little brass knob on the wall, in a place that, at the top of a short soft staircase, struck her as the most beautiful she had ever seen in her life. ", "The next thing she perceived it to be was the drawing-room of a lady-of a lady, she could see in a moment, and not of a gentleman, not even of one like papa himself or even like Sir Claude-whose things were as much prettier than mamma's as it had always had to be confessed that mamma's were prettier than Mrs. Beale's. ", "In the middle of the small bright room and the presence of more curtains and cushions, more pictures and mirrors, more palm-trees drooping over brocaded and gilded nooks, more little silver boxes scattered over little crooked tables and little oval miniatures hooked upon velvet screens than Mrs. Beale and her ladyship together could, in an unnatural alliance, have dreamed of mustering, the child became aware, with a sharp foretaste of compassion, of something that was strangely like a relegation to obscurity of each of those women of taste. ", "It was a stranger operation still that her father should on the spot be presented to her as quite advantageously and even grandly at home in the dazzling scene and himself by so much the more separated from scenes inferior to it. ", "She spent with him in it, while explanations continued to hang back, twenty minutes that, in their sudden drop of danger, affected her, though there were neither buns nor ginger-beer, like an extemporised expensive treat. \" ", "Is she very rich?\" ", "He had begun to strike her as almost embarrassed, so shy that he might have found himself with a young lady with whom he had little in common. ", "She was literally moved by this apprehension to offer him some tactful relief. ", "Beale Farange stood and smiled at his young lady, his back to the fanciful fireplace, his light overcoat-the very lightest in London-wide open, and his wonderful lustrous beard completely concealing the expanse of his shirt-front. ", "It pleased her more than ever to think that papa was handsome and, though as high aloft as mamma and almost, in his specially florid evening-dress, as splendid, of a beauty somehow less belligerent, less terrible. ", "\"The Countess? ", "Why do you ask me that? ", "\" Maisie's eyes opened wider. \" ", "Is she a Countess?\" ", "He seemed to treat her wonder as a positive tribute. ", "\" Oh yes, my dear, but it isn't an English title. ", "Her manner appreciated this. \" ", "Is it a French one?\" ", "\"No, nor French either. ", "It's American.\" ", "She conversed agreeably. \" ", "Ah then of course she must be rich. ", "\" She took in such a combination of nationality and rank. ", "\" I never saw anything so lovely.\" ", "\"Did you have a sight of her?\" ", "Beale asked. ", "At the Exhibition? ", "\" Maisie smiled. ", "\" She was gone too quick.\" ", "Her father laughed. ", "\" She did slope!\" ", "She had feared he would say something about Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude, yet the way he spared them made her rather uneasy too. ", "All he risked was, the next minute, \"She has a horror of vulgar scenes. ", "\" This was something she needn't take up; ", "she could still continue bland. \" ", "But where do you suppose she went?\" ", "\"Oh I thought she'd have taken a cab and have been here by this time. ", "But she'll turn up all right.\" ", "\"I'm sure I hope she will,\" Maisie said; ", "she spoke with an earnestness begotten of the impression of all the beauty about them, to which, in person, the Countess might make further contribution. ", "\" We came awfully fast,\" she added. ", "Her father again laughed loud. ", "\" Yes, my dear, I made you step out!\" ", "He waited an instant, then pursued: ", "I want her to see you. ", "\" Maisie, at this, rejoiced in the attention that, for their evening out, Mrs. Beale, even to the extent of personally \"doing up\" her old hat, had given her appearance. ", "Meanwhile her father went on: ", "You'll like her awfully.\" ", "\"Oh I'm sure I shall!\" ", "After which, either from the effect of having said so much or from that of a sudden glimpse of the impossibility of saying more, she felt an embarrassment and sought refuge in a minor branch of the subject. ", "\" I thought she was Mrs. Cuddon. ", "\" Beale's gaiety rather increased than diminished. ", "\" You mean my wife did? ", "My dear child, my wife's a damned fool! ", "He had the oddest air of speaking of his wife as of a person whom she might scarcely have known, so that the refuge of her scruple didn't prove particularly happy. ", "Beale on the other hand appeared after an instant himself to feel a scruple. ", "\" What I mean is, to speak seriously, that she doesn't really know anything about anything.\" ", "He paused, following the child's charmed eyes and tentative step or two as they brought her nearer to the pretty things on one of the tables. \" ", "She thinks she has good things, don't you know!\" ", "He quite jeered at Mrs. Beale's delusion. ", "Maisie felt she must confess that it was one; ", "everything she had missed at the side-shows was made up to her by the Countess's luxuries. ", "\" Yes,\" she considered; ", "\"she does think that. ", "\" There was again a dryness in the way Beale replied that it didn't matter what she thought; ", "but there was an increasing sweetness for his daughter in being with him so long without his doing anything worse. ", "The whole hour of course was to remain with her, for days and weeks, ineffaceably illumined and confirmed; ", "by the end of which she was able to read into it a hundred things that had been at the moment mere miraculous pleasantness. ", "What they at the moment came to was simply that her companion was still in a good deal of a flutter, yet wished not to show it, and that just in proportion as he succeeded in this attempt he was able to encourage her to regard him as kind. ", "He moved about the room after a little, showed her things, spoke to her as a person of taste, told her the name, which she remembered, of the famous French lady represented in one of the miniatures, and remarked, as if he had caught her wistful over a trinket or a trailing stuff, that he made no doubt the Countess, on coming in, would give her something jolly. ", "He spied a pink satin box with a looking-glass let into the cover, which he raised, with a quick facetious flourish, to offer her the privilege of six rows of chocolate bonbons, cutting out thereby Sir Claude, who had never gone beyond four rows. ", "\" I can do what I like with these,\" he said, \"for I don't mind telling you I gave 'em to her myself.\" ", "The Countess had evidently appreciated the gift; ", "there were numerous gaps, a ravage now quite unchecked, in the array. ", "Even while they waited together Maisie had her sense, which was the mark of what their separation had become, of her having grown for him, since the last time he had, as it were, noticed her, and by increase of years and of inches if by nothing else, much more of a little person to reckon with. ", "Yes, this was a part of the positive awkwardness that he carried off by being almost foolishly tender. ", "There was a passage during which, on a yellow silk sofa under one of the palms, he had her on his knee, stroking her hair, playfully holding her off while he showed his shining fangs and let her, with a vague affectionate helpless pointless \"Dear old girl, dear little daughter,\" inhale the fragrance of his cherished beard. ", "She must have been sorry for him, she afterwards knew, so well could she privately follow his difficulty in being specific to her about anything. ", "She had such possibilities of vibration, of response, that it needed nothing more than this to make up to her in fact for omissions. ", "The tears came into her eyes again as they had done when in the Park that day the Captain told her so \"splendidly\" that her mother was good. ", "What was this but splendid too-this still directer goodness of her father and this unexampled shining solitude with him, out of which everything had dropped but that he was papa and that he was magnificent? ", "It didn't spoil it that she finally felt he must have, as he became restless, ", "some purpose he didn't quite see his way to bring out, for in the freshness of their recovered fellowship she would have lent herself gleefully to his suggesting, or even to his pretending, that their relations were easy and graceful. ", "There was something in him that seemed, and quite touchingly, to ask her to help him to pretend-pretend he knew enough about her life and her education, her means of subsistence and her view of himself, to give the questions he couldn't put her a natural domestic tone. ", "She would have pretended with ecstasy if he could only have given her the cue. ", "She waited for it while, between his big teeth, he breathed the sighs she didn't know to be stupid. ", "And as if, though he was so stupid all through, he had let the friendly suffusion of her eyes yet tell him she was ready for anything, he floundered about, wondering what the devil he could lay hold of. ", "XIX   When he had lighted a cigarette and begun to smoke in her face it was as if he had struck with the match the note of some queer clumsy ferment of old professions, old scandals, old duties, a dim perception of what he possessed in her and what, if everything had only-damn it!-been totally different, she might still be able to give him. ", "What she was able to give him, however, as his blinking eyes seemed to make out through the smoke, would be simply what he should be able to get from her. ", "To give something, to give here on the spot, was all her own desire. ", "Among the old things that came back was her little instinct of keeping the peace; ", "it made her wonder more sharply what particular thing she could do or not do, what particular word she could speak or not speak, what particular line she could take or not take, that might for every one, even for the Countess, give a better turn to the crisis. ", "She was ready, in this interest, for an immense surrender, a surrender of everything but Sir Claude, of everything but Mrs. Beale. ", "The immensity didn't include them; ", "but if he had an idea at the back of his head she had also one in a recess as deep, and for a time, while they sat together, there was an extraordinary mute passage between her vision of this vision of his, his vision of her vision, and her vision of his vision of her vision. ", "What there was no effective record of indeed was the small strange pathos on the child's part of an innocence so saturated with knowledge and so directed to diplomacy. ", "What, further, Beale finally laid hold of while he masked again with his fine presence half the flounces of the fireplace was: ", "Do you know, my dear, I shall soon be off to America? ", "It struck his daughter both as a short cut and as the way he wouldn't have said it to his wife. ", "But his wife figured with a bright superficial assurance in her response. \" ", "Do you mean with Mrs. Beale?\" ", "Her father looked at her hard. \" ", "Don't be a little ass!\" ", "Her silence appeared to represent a concentrated effort not to be. \" ", "Then with the Countess?\" ", "\"With her or without her, my dear; ", "that concerns only your poor daddy. ", "She has big interests over there, and she wants me to take a look at them. ", "\" Maisie threw herself into them. \" ", "Will that take very long?\" ", "\"Yes; ", "they're in such a muddle-it may take months. ", "Now what I want to hear, you know, is whether you'd like to come along?\" ", "Planted once more before him in the middle of the room she felt herself turning white. ", "\" I?\" ", "she gasped, yet feeling as soon as she had spoken that such a note of dismay was not altogether pretty. ", "She felt it still more while her father replied, with a shake of his legs, a toss of his cigarette-ash and a fidgety look-he was for ever taking one-all the length of his waistcoat and trousers, that she needn't be quite so disgusted. ", "It helped her in a few seconds to appear more as he would like her that she saw, in the lovely light of the Countess's splendour, exactly, however she appeared, the right answer to make. \" ", "Dear papa, I'll go with you anywhere.\" ", "He turned his back to her and stood with his nose at the glass of the chimneypiece while he brushed specks of ash out of his beard. ", "Then he abruptly said: ", "Do you know anything about your brute of a mother? ", "\" It was just of her brute of a mother that the manner of the question in a remarkable degree reminded her: ", "it had the free flight of one of Ida's fine bridgings of space. ", "With the sense of this was kindled for Maisie at the same time an inspiration. ", "Oh yes, I know everything!\" ", "and she became so radiant that her father, seeing it in the mirror, turned back to her and presently, on the sofa, had her at his knee again and was again particularly affecting. ", "Maisie's inspiration instructed her, pressingly, that the more she should be able to say about mamma the less she would be called upon to speak of her step-parents. ", "She kept hoping the Countess would come in before her power to protect them was exhausted; ", "and it was now, in closer quarters with her companion, that the idea at the back of her head shifted its place to her lips. ", "She told him she had met her mother in the Park with a gentleman who, while Sir Claude had strolled with her ladyship, had been kind and had sat and talked to her; ", "narrating the scene with a remembrance of her pledge of secrecy to the Captain quite brushed away by the joy of seeing Beale listen without profane interruption. ", "It was almost an amazement, but it was indeed all a joy, thus to be able to guess that papa was at last quite tired of his anger-of his anger at any rate about mamma. ", "He was only bored with her now. ", "That made it, however, the more imperative that his spent displeasure shouldn't be blown out again. ", "It charmed the child to see how much she could interest him; ", "and the charm remained even when, after asking her a dozen questions, he observed musingly and a little obscurely: ", "\"Yes, damned if she won't!\" ", "For in this too there was a detachment, a wise weariness that made her feel safe. ", "She had had to mention Sir Claude, though she mentioned him as little as possible and Beale only appeared to look quite over his head. ", "It pieced itself together for her that this was the mildness of general indifference, a source of profit so great for herself personally that if the Countess was the author of it she was prepared literally to hug the Countess. ", "She betrayed that eagerness by a restless question about her, to which her father replied: ", "Oh she has a head on her shoulders. ", "I'll back her to get out of anything!\" ", "He looked at Maisie quite as if he could trace the connexion between her enquiry and the impatience of her gratitude. \" ", "Do you mean to say you'd really come with me?\" ", "She felt as if he were now looking at her very hard indeed, and also as if she had grown ever so much older. ", "\" I'll do anything in the world you ask me, papa.\" ", "He gave again, with a laugh and with his legs apart, his proprietary glance at his waistcoat and trousers. ", "\" That's a way, my dear, of saying 'No, thank you!' ", "You know you don't want to go the least little mite. ", "You can't humbug me!\" ", "Beale Farange laid down. ", "\" I don't want to bully you-I never bullied you in my life; ", "but I make you the offer, and it's to take or to leave. ", "Your mother will never again have any more to do with you than if you were a kitchenmaid she had turned out for going wrong. ", "Therefore of course I'm your natural protector and you've a right to get everything out of me you can. ", "Now's your chance, you know-you won't be half-clever if you don't. ", "You can't say I don't put it before you-you can't say I ain't kind to you or that I don't play fair. ", "Mind you never say that, you know-it would bring me down on you. ", "I know what's proper. ", "I'll take you again, just as I have taken you again and again. ", "And I'm much obliged to you for making up such a face. ", "\" She was conscious enough that her face indeed couldn't please him if it showed any sign-just as she hoped it didn't-of her sharp impression of what he now really wanted to do. ", "Wasn't he trying to turn the tables on her, embarrass her somehow into admitting that what would really suit her little book would be, after doing so much for good manners, to leave her wholly at liberty to arrange for herself? ", "She began to be nervous again: ", "it rolled over her that this was their parting, their parting for ever, and that he had brought her there for so many caresses only because it was important such an occasion should look better for him than any other. ", "For her to spoil it by the note of discord would certainly give him ground for complaint; ", "and the child was momentarily bewildered between her alternatives of agreeing with him about her wanting to get rid of him and displeasing him by pretending to stick to him. ", "So she found for the moment no solution but to murmur very helplessly: ", "Oh papa-oh papa!\" ", "\"I know what you're up to-don't tell me!\" ", "After which he came straight over and, in the most inconsequent way in the world, clasped her in his arms a moment and rubbed his beard against her cheek. ", "Then she understood as well as if he had spoken it that what he wanted, hang it, was that she should let him off with all the honours-with all the appearance of virtue and sacrifice on his side. ", "It was exactly as if he had broken out to her: ", "I say, you little booby, help me to be irreproachable, to be noble, and yet to have none of the beastly bore of it. ", "There's only impropriety enough for one of us; ", "so you must take it all. ", "Repudiate your dear old daddy-in the face, mind you, of his tender supplications. ", "He can't be rough with you-it isn't in his nature: ", "therefore you'll have successfully chucked him because he was too generous to be as firm with you, poor man, as was, after all, his duty. ", "\" This was what he communicated in a series of tremendous pats on the back; ", "that portion of her person had never been so thumped since Moddle thumped her when she choked. ", "After a moment he gave her the further impression of having become sure enough of her to be able very gracefully to say out: ", "You know your mother loathes you, loathes you simply. ", "And I've been thinking over your precious man-the fellow you told me about.\" ", "\"Well,\" Maisie replied with competence, \"I'm sure of him.\" ", "Her father was vague for an instant. \" ", "Do you mean sure of his liking you?\" ", "\"Oh no; ", "of his liking her! ", "\" Beale had a return of gaiety. ", "\" There's no accounting for tastes! ", "It's what they all say, you know.\" ", "\"I don't care-I'm sure of him!\" ", "Maisie repeated. ", "Sure, you mean, that she'll bolt? ", "\" Maisie knew all about bolting, but, decidedly, she was older, and there was something in her that could wince at the way her father made the ugly word-ugly enough at best-sound flat and low. ", "It prompted her to amend his allusion, which she did by saying: ", "I don't know what she'll do. ", "But she'll be happy.\" ", "\"Let us hope so,\" said Beale-almost as for edification. ", "\" The more happy she is at any rate the less she'll want you about. ", "That's why I press you,\" he agreeably pursued, \"to consider this handsome offer-I mean seriously, you know-of your sole surviving parent. ", "\" Their eyes, at this, met again in a long and extraordinary communion which terminated in his ejaculating: ", "Ah you little scoundrel! ", "\" She took it from him in the manner it seemed to her he would like best and with a success that encouraged him to go on: ", "You are a deep little devil!\" ", "Her silence, ticking like a watch, acknowledged even this, in confirmation of which he finally brought out: ", "You've settled it with the other pair!\" ", "\"Well, what if I have? ", "\" She sounded to herself most bold. ", "Her father, quite as in the old days, broke into a peal. ", "\" Why, don't you know they're awful? ", "She grew bolder still. ", "\" I don't care-not a bit!\" ", "\"But they're probably the worst people in the world and the very greatest criminals,\" Beale pleasantly urged. ", "\" I'm not the man, my dear, not to let you know it.\" ", "\"Well, it doesn't prevent them from loving me. ", "They love me tremendously. ", "\" Maisie turned crimson to hear herself. ", "Her companion fumbled; ", "almost any one-let alone a daughter-would have seen how conscientious he wanted to be. ", "\" I dare say. ", "But do you know why?\" ", "She braved his eyes and he added: ", "You're a jolly good pretext.\" ", "\"For what? ", "Maisie asked. ", "\"Why, for their game. ", "I needn't tell you what that is. ", "The child reflected. ", "\" Well then that's all the more reason.\" ", "\"Reason for what, pray?\" ", "\"For their being kind to me.\" ", "\"And for your keeping in with them?\" ", "Beale roared again; ", "it was as if his spirits rose and rose. \" ", "Do you realise, pray, that in saying that you're a monster?\" ", "She turned it over. \" ", "A monster?\" ", "\"They've made one of you. ", "Upon my honour it's quite awful. ", "It shows the kind of people they are. ", "Don't you understand,\" Beale pursued, \"that when they've made you as horrid as they can-as horrid as themselves-they'll just simply chuck you?\" ", "She had at this a flicker of passion. ", "\" They won't chuck me!\" ", "\"I beg your pardon,\" her father courteously insisted; ", "it's my duty to put it before you. ", "I shouldn't forgive myself if I didn't point out to you that they'll cease to require you.\" ", "He spoke as if with an appeal to her intelligence that she must be ashamed not adequately to meet, and this gave a real distinction to his superior delicacy.

", "That's his game. ", "It will suit him down to the ground. ", "\" This was a proposition Maisie could perfectly embrace, but it still left a loophole for triumph. ", "She turned it well over. ", "\" You mean if mamma doesn't come back ever at all?\" ", "The composure with which her face was presented to that prospect would have shown a spectator the long road she had travelled. \" ", "Well, but that won't put Mrs. Beale-\"  \"In the same comfortable position-? ", "\" Beale took her up with relish; ", "he had sprung to his feet again, shaking his legs and looking at his shoes. ", "Right you are, darling! ", "Something more will be wanted for Mrs. Beale. ", "He just paused, then he added: ", "But she may not have long to wait for it. ", "Maisie also for a minute looked at his shoes, though they were not the pair she most admired, the laced yellow \"uppers\" and patent-leather complement. ", "At last, with a question, she raised her eyes. ", "Aren't you coming back? ", "Once more he hung fire; ", "after which he gave a small laugh that in the oddest way in the world reminded her of the unique sounds she had heard emitted by Mrs. Wix. ", "\" It may strike you as extraordinary that I should make you such an admission; ", "and in point of fact you're not to understand that I do. ", "But we'll put it that way to help your decision. ", "The point is that that's the way my wife will presently be sure to put it. ", "You'll hear her shrieking that she's deserted, so that she may just pile up her wrongs. ", "She'll be as free as she likes then-as free, you see, as your mother's muff of a husband. ", "They won't have anything more to consider and they'll just put you into the street. ", "Do I understand,\" Beale enquired, \"that, in the face of what I press on you, you still prefer to take the risk of that? ", "\" It was the most wonderful appeal any gentleman had ever addressed to his daughter, and it had placed Maisie in the middle of the room again while her father moved slowly about her with his hands in his pockets and something in his step that seemed, more than anything else he had done, to show the habit of the place. ", "She turned her fevered little eyes over his friend's brightnesses, as if, on her own side, to press for some help in a quandary unexampled. ", "As if also the pressure reached him he after an instant stopped short, completing the prodigy of his attitude and the pride of his loyalty by a supreme formulation of the general inducement. ", "\" You've an eye, love! ", "Yes, there's money. ", "No end of money. ", "This affected her at first in the manner of some great flashing dazzle in one of the pantomimes to which Sir Claude had taken her: ", "she saw nothing in it but what it directly conveyed. \" ", "And shall I never, never see you again-?\" ", "\"If I do go to America?\" ", "Beale brought it out like a man. ", "Never, never, never!\" ", "Hereupon, with the utmost absurdity, she broke down; ", "everything gave way, everything but the horror of hearing herself definitely utter such an ugliness as the acceptance of that. ", "So she only stiffened herself and said: ", "Then I can't give you up.\" ", "She held him some seconds looking at her, showing her a strained grimace, a perfect parade of all his teeth, in which it seemed to her she could read the disgust he didn't quite like to express at this departure from the pliability she had practically promised. ", "But before she could attenuate in any way the crudity of her collapse he gave an impatient jerk which took him to the window. ", "She heard a vehicle stop; ", "Beale looked out; ", "then he freshly faced her. ", "He still said nothing, but she knew the Countess had come back. ", "There was a silence again between them, but with a different shade of embarrassment from that of their united arrival; ", "and it was still without speaking that, abruptly repeating one of the embraces of which he had already been so prodigal, he whisked her back to the lemon sofa just before the door of the room was thrown open. ", "It was thus in renewed and intimate union with him that she was presented to a person whom she instantly recognised as the brown lady. ", "The brown lady looked almost as astonished, though not quite as alarmed, as when, at the Exhibition, she had gasped in the face of Mrs. Beale. ", "Maisie in truth almost gasped in her own; ", "this was with the fuller perception that she was brown indeed. ", "She literally struck the child more as an animal than as a \"real\" lady; ", "she might have been a clever frizzled poodle in a frill or a dreadful human monkey in a spangled petticoat. ", "She had a nose that was far too big and eyes that were far too small and a moustache that was, well, not so happy a feature as Sir Claude's. ", "Beale jumped up to her; ", "while, to the child's astonishment, though as if in a quick intensity of thought, the Countess advanced as gaily as if, for many a day, nothing awkward had happened for any one. ", "Maisie, in spite of a large acquaintance with the phenomenon, had never seen it so promptly established that nothing awkward was to be mentioned. ", "The next minute the Countess had kissed her and exclaimed to Beale with bright tender reproach: ", "Why, you never told me half! ", "My dear child,\" she cried, \"it was awfully nice of you to come!\" ", "\"But she hasn't come-she won't come!\" ", "Beale answered. ", "\" I've put it to her how much you'd like it, but she declines to have anything to do with us.\" ", "The Countess stood smiling, and after an instant that was mainly taken up with the shock of her weird aspect Maisie felt herself reminded of another smile, which was not ugly, though also interested-the kind light thrown, that day in the Park, from the clean fair face of the Captain. ", "Papa's Captain-yes-was the Countess; ", "but she wasn't nearly so nice as the other: ", "it all came back, doubtless, to Maisie's minor appreciation of ladies. ", "\" Shouldn't you like me,\" said this one endearingly, \"to take you to Spa?\" ", "\"To Spa?\" ", "The child repeated the name to gain time, not to show how the Countess brought back to her a dim remembrance of a strange woman with a horrid face who once, years before, in an omnibus, bending to her from an opposite seat, had suddenly produced an orange and murmured \"Little dearie, won't you have it? ", "She had felt then, for some reason, a small silly terror, though afterwards conscious that her interlocutress, unfortunately hideous, had particularly meant to be kind. ", "This was also what the Countess meant; ", "yet the few words she had uttered and the smile with which she had uttered them immediately cleared everything up. ", "Oh no, she wanted to go nowhere with her, for her presence had already, in a few seconds, dissipated the happy impression of the room and put an end to the pleasure briefly taken in Beale's command of such elegance. ", "There was no command of elegance in his having exposed her to the approach of the short fat wheedling whiskered person in whom she had now to recognise the only figure wholly without attraction involved in any of the intimate connexions her immediate circle had witnessed the growth of. ", "She was abashed meanwhile, however, at having appeared to weigh in the balance the place to which she had been invited; ", "and she added as quickly as possible: ", "It isn't to America then? ", "\" The Countess, at this, looked sharply at Beale, and Beale, airily enough, asked what the deuce it mattered when she had already given him to understand she wanted to have nothing to do with them. ", "There followed between her companions a passage of which the sense was drowned for her in the deepening inward hum of her mere desire to get off; ", "though she was able to guess later on that her father must have put it to his friend that it was no use talking, that she was an obstinate little pig and that, besides, she was really old enough to choose for herself. ", "It glimmered back to her indeed that she must have failed quite dreadfully to seem ideally other than rude, inasmuch as before she knew it she had visibly given the impression that if they didn't allow her to go home she should cry. ", "Oh if there had ever been a thing to cry about it was being so consciously and gawkily below the handsomest offers any one could ever have received. ", "The great pain of the thing was that she could see the Countess liked her enough to wish to be liked in return, and it was from the idea of a return she sought utterly to flee. ", "It was the idea of a return that after a confusion of loud words had broken out between the others brought to her lips with the tremor preceding disaster: ", "Can't I, please, be sent home in a cab?\" ", "Yes, the Countess wanted her and the Countess was wounded and chilled, and she couldn't help it, and it was all the more dreadful because it only made the Countess more coaxing and more impossible. ", "The only thing that sustained either of them perhaps till the cab came-Maisie presently saw it would come-was its being in the air somehow that Beale had done what he wanted. ", "He went out to look for a conveyance; ", "the servants, he said, had gone to bed, but she shouldn't be kept beyond her time. ", "The Countess left the room with him, and, alone in the possession of it, Maisie hoped she wouldn't come back. ", "It was all the effect of her face-the child simply couldn't look at it and meet its expression halfway. ", "All in a moment too that queer expression had leaped into the lovely things-all in a moment she had had to accept her father as liking some one whom she was sure neither her mother, nor Mrs. Beale, nor Mrs. Wix, nor Sir Claude, nor the Captain, nor even Mr. Perriam and Lord Eric could possibly have liked. ", "Three minutes later, downstairs, with the cab at the door, it was perhaps as a final confession of not having much to boast of that, on taking leave of her, he managed to press her to his bosom without her seeing his face. ", "For herself she was so eager to go that their parting reminded her of nothing, not even of a single one of all the \"nevers\" that above, as the penalty of not cleaving to him, he had attached to the question of their meeting again. ", "There was something in the Countess that falsified everything, even the great interests in America and yet more the first flush of that superiority to Mrs. Beale and to mamma which had been expressed in S\u00e8vres sets and silver boxes. ", "These were still there, but perhaps there were no great interests in America. ", "Mamma had known an American who was not a bit like this one. ", "She was not, however, of noble rank; ", "her name was only Mrs. Tucker. ", "Maisie's detachment would none the less have been more complete if she had not suddenly had to exclaim: ", "\"Oh dear, I haven't any money!\" ", "Her father's teeth, at this, were such a picture of appetite without action as to be a match for any plea of poverty. \" ", "Make your stepmother pay.\" ", "\"Stepmothers don't pay!\" cried the Countess. \" ", "No stepmother ever paid in her life!\" ", "The next moment they were in the street together, and the next the child was in the cab, with the Countess, on the pavement, but close to her, quickly taking money from a purse whisked out of a pocket. ", "Her father had vanished and there was even yet nothing in that to reawaken the pang of loss. \" ", "Here's money,\" said the brown lady: ", "\"go!\" ", "The sound was commanding: ", "the cab rattled off. ", "Maisie sat there with her hand full of coin. ", "All that for a cab? ", "As they passed a street-lamp she bent to see how much. ", "What she saw was a cluster of sovereigns. ", "There must then have been great interests in America. ", "It was still at any rate the Arabian Nights. ", "XX    ", "The money was far too much even for a fee in a fairy-tale, and in the absence of Mrs. Beale, who, though the hour was now late, had not yet returned to the Regent's Park, Susan Ash, in the hall, as loud as Maisie was low and as bold as she was bland, produced, on the exhibition offered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a contrast to the child's recent scene of light, the half-crown that an unsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take. ", "It was apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval Maisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like a darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table upstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a housemaid than to the subject of the man\u0153uvres of a quartette. ", "This subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted handkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her pillow; ", "but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more complete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free. ", "There were explanations indeed that Mrs. Beale had to give as well as to ask, and the most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for a little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of their sex. ", "The sovereigns were examined with some attention, the result of which, however, was to make the author of that statement desire to know what, if one really went into the matter, they could be called but the wages of sin. ", "Her companion went into it merely so far as the question of what then they were to do with them; ", "on which Mrs. Beale, who had by this time put them into her pocket, replied with dignity and with her hand on the place: ", "We're to send them back on the spot!\" ", "Susan, the child soon afterwards learnt, had been invited to contribute to this act of restitution her one appropriated coin; ", "but a closer clutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to Maisie that there was a limit to the way she could be \"done. ", "\" Maisie had been open with Mrs. Beale about the whole of last night's transaction; ", "but she now found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient of remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that lady's own suppressions. ", "One of these bore upon the extraordinary hour-it was three in the morning if she really wanted to know-at which Mrs. Beale had re-entered the house; ", "another, in accents as to which Maisie's criticism was still intensely tacit, characterised her appeal as such a \"gime,\" such a \"shime,\" as one had never had to put up with; ", "a third treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due belowstairs, in every department, for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal. ", "Our young lady's consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her attendant's sense of wrong. ", "These days would become terrific like the Revolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the kitchen should crown them; ", "and to promote that prospect she had through Susan's eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are prepared. ", "To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to the inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to have been the circumstance of one's being called a horrid low thief for refusing to part with one's own. ", "The redeeming point of this tension was, on the fifth day, that it actually appeared to have had to do with a breathless perception in our heroine's breast that scarcely more as the centre of Sir Claude's than as that of Susan's energies she had soon after breakfast been conveyed from London to Folkestone and established at a lovely hotel. ", "These agents, before her wondering eyes, had combined to carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed its success to the fact that Mrs. Beale had, as Susan said, but just stepped out. ", "When Sir Claude, watch in hand, had met this fact with the exclamation \"Then pack Miss Farange and come off with us! ", "there had ensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring Miss Farange's heart into Miss Farange's mouth. ", "She sat with Sir Claude in a four-wheeler while he still held his watch; ", "held it longer than any doctor who had ever felt her pulse; ", "long enough to give her a vision of something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to show impatience. ", "The ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the Berceuse, quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day, a little while back, when Susan had panted up and she herself, after the hint about the duchess, had sailed down; ", "for what harm then had there been in drops and disappointments if she could still have, even only a moment, the sensation of such a name \"brought up\"? ", "It had remained with her that her father had foretold her she would some day be in the street, but it clearly wouldn't be this day, and she felt justified of the preference betrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set Susan in motion and laid his hand, while she waited with him, kindly on her own. ", "This was what the Captain, in Kensington Gardens, had done; ", "her present situation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder of the fashion after which, from the first, such pats and pulls had struck her as the steps and signs of other people's business and even a little as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties. ", "What had failed her and what had frightened her on the night of the Exhibition lost themselves at present alike in the impression that any \"surprise\" now about to burst from Sir Claude would be too big to burst all at once. ", "Any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her stepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule, the odd truth that if Mrs. Beale now never came nor went without making her think of him, it was never, to balance that, the main mark of his own renewed reality to appear to be a reference to Mrs. Beale. ", "To be with Sir Claude was to think of Sir Claude, and that law governed Maisie's mind until, through a sudden lurch of the cab, which had at last taken in Susan and ever so many bundles and almost reached Charing Cross, it popped again somehow into her dizzy head the long-lost image of Mrs. Wix. ", "It was singular, but from this time she understood and she followed, followed with the sense of an ample filling-out of any void created by symptoms of avoidance and of flight. ", "Her ecstasy was a thing that had yet more of a face than of a back to turn, a pair of eyes still directed to Mrs. Wix even after the slight surprise of their not finding her, as the journey expanded, either at the London station or at the Folkestone hotel. ", "It took few hours to make the child feel that if she was in neither of these places she was at least everywhere else. ", "Maisie had known all along a great deal, but never so much as she was to know from this moment on and as she learned in particular during the couple of days that she was to hang in the air, as it were, over the sea which represented in breezy blueness and with a summer charm a crossing of more spaces than the Channel. ", "It was granted her at this time to arrive at divinations so ample that I shall have no room for the goal if I attempt to trace the stages; ", "as to which therefore I must be content to say that the fullest expression we may give to Sir Claude's conduct is a poor and pale copy of the picture it presented to his young friend. ", "Abruptly, that morning, he had yielded to the action of the idea pumped into him for weeks by Mrs. Wix on lines of approach that she had been capable of the extraordinary art of preserving from entanglement in the fine network of his relations with Mrs. Beale. ", "The breath of her sincerity, blowing without a break, had puffed him up to the flight by which, in the degree I have indicated, Maisie too was carried off her feet. ", "This consisted neither in more nor in less than the brave stroke of his getting off from Mrs. Beale as well as from his wife-of making with the child straight for some such foreign land as would give a support to Mrs. Wix's dream that she might still see his errors renounced and his delinquencies redeemed. ", "It would all be a sacrifice-under eyes that would miss no faintest shade-to what even the strange frequenters of her ladyship's earlier period used to call the real good of the little unfortunate. ", "Maisie's head held a suspicion of much that, during the last long interval, had confusedly, but quite candidly, come and gone in his own; ", "a glimpse, almost awe-stricken in its gratitude, of the miracle her old governess had wrought. ", "That functionary could not in this connexion have been more impressive, even at second-hand, if she had been a prophetess with an open scroll or some ardent abbess speaking with the lips of the Church. ", "She had clung day by day to their plastic associate, plying him with her deep, narrow passion, doing her simple utmost to convert him, and so working on him that he had at last really embraced his fine chance. ", "That the chance was not delusive was sufficiently guaranteed by the completeness with which he could finally figure it out that, in case of his taking action, neither Ida nor Beale, whose book, on each side, it would only too well suit, would make any sort of row. ", "It sounds, no doubt, too penetrating, but it was not all as an effect of Sir Claude's betrayals that Maisie was able to piece together the beauty of the special influence through which, for such stretches of time, he had refined upon propriety by keeping, so far as possible, his sentimental interests distinct. ", "She had ever of course in her mind fewer names than conceptions, but it was only with this drawback that she now made out her companion's absences to have had for their ground that he was the lover of her stepmother and that the lover of her stepmother could scarce logically pretend to a superior right to look after her. ", "Maisie had by this time embraced the implication of a kind of natural divergence between lovers and little girls. ", "It was just this indeed that could throw light on the probable contents of the pencilled note deposited on the hall-table in the Regent's Park and which would greet Mrs. Beale on her return. ", "Maisie freely figured it as provisionally jocular in tone, even though to herself on this occasion Sir Claude turned a graver face than he had shown in any crisis but that of putting her into the cab when she had been horrid to him after her parting with the Captain. ", "He might really be embarrassed, but he would be sure, to her view, to have muffled in some bravado of pleasantry the disturbance produced at her father's by the removal of a valued servant. ", "Not that there wasn't a great deal too that wouldn't be in the note-a great deal for which a more comfortable place was Maisie's light little brain, where it hummed away hour after hour and caused the first outlook at Folkestone to swim in a softness of colour and sound. ", "It became clear in this medium that her stepfather had really now only to take into account his entanglement with Mrs. Beale. ", "Wasn't he at last disentangled from every one and every thing else? ", "The obstacle to the rupture pressed upon him by Mrs. Wix in the interest of his virtue would be simply that he was in love, or rather, to put it more precisely, that Mrs. Beale had left him no doubt of the degree in which she was. ", "She was so much so as to have succeeded in making him accept for a time her infatuated grasp of him and even to some extent the idea of what they yet might do together with a little diplomacy and a good deal of patience. ", "I may not even answer for it that Maisie was not aware of how, in this, Mrs. Beale failed to share his all but insurmountable distaste for their allowing their little charge to breathe the air of their gross irregularity-his contention, in a word, that they should either cease to be irregular or cease to be parental. ", "Their little charge, for herself, had long ago adopted the view that even Mrs. Wix had at one time not thought prohibitively coarse-the view that she was after all, as a little charge, morally at home in atmospheres it would be appalling to analyse. ", "If Mrs. Wix, however, ultimately appalled, had now set her heart on strong measures, Maisie, as I have intimated, could also work round both to the reasons for them and to the quite other reasons for that lady's not, as yet at least, appearing in them at first-hand. ", "Oh decidedly I shall never get you to believe the number of things she saw and the number of secrets she discovered! ", "Why in the world, for instance, couldn't Sir Claude have kept it from her-except on the hypothesis of his not caring to-that, when you came to look at it and so far as it was a question of vested interests, he had quite as much right in her as her stepmother, not to say a right that Mrs. Beale was in no position to dispute? ", "He failed at all events of any such successful ambiguity as could keep her, when once they began to look across at France, from regarding even what was least explained as most in the spirit of their old happy times, their rambles and expeditions in the easier better days of their first acquaintance. ", "Never before had she had so the sense of giving him a lead for the sort of treatment of what was between them that would best carry it off, or of his being grateful to her for meeting him so much in the right place. ", "She met him literally at the very point where Mrs. Beale was most to be reckoned with, the point of the jealousy that was sharp in that lady and of the need of their keeping it as long as possible obscure to her that poor Mrs. Wix had still a hand. ", "Yes, she met him too in the truth of the matter that, as her stepmother had had no one else to be jealous of, she had made up for so gross a privation by directing the sentiment to a moral influence. ", "Sir Claude appeared absolutely to convey in a wink that a moral influence capable of pulling a string was after all a moral influence exposed to the scratching out of its eyes; ", "and that, this being the case, there was somebody they couldn't afford to leave unprotected before they should see a little better what Mrs. Beale was likely to do. ", "Maisie, true enough, had not to put it into words to rejoin, in the coffee-room, at luncheon: ", "What can she do but come to you if papa does take a step that will amount to legal desertion?\" ", "Neither had he then, in answer, to articulate anything but the jollity of their having found a table at a window from which, as they partook of cold beef and apollinaris-for he hinted they would have to save lots of money-they could let their eyes hover tenderly on the far-off white cliffs that so often had signalled to the embarrassed English a promise of safety. ", "Maisie stared at them as if she might really make out after a little a queer dear figure perched on them-a figure as to which she had already the subtle sense that, wherever perched, it would be the very oddest yet seen in France. ", "But it was at least as exciting to feel where Mrs. Wix wasn't as it would have been to know where she was, and if she wasn't yet at Boulogne this only thickened the plot. ", "If she was not to be seen that day, however, the evening was marked by an apparition before which, none the less, overstrained suspense folded on the spot its wings. ", "Adjusting her respirations and attaching, under dropped lashes, all her thoughts to a smartness of frock and frill for which she could reflect that she had not appealed in vain to a loyalty in Susan Ash triumphant over the nice things their feverish flight had left behind, Maisie spent on a bench in the garden of the hotel the half-hour before dinner, that mysterious ceremony of the table d'h\u00f4te for which she had prepared with a punctuality of flutter. ", "Sir Claude, beside her, was occupied with a cigarette and the afternoon papers; ", "and though the hotel was full the garden shewed the particular void that ensues upon the sound of the dressing-bell. ", "She had almost had time to weary of the human scene; ", "her own humanity at any rate, in the shape of a smutch on her scanty skirt, had held her so long that as soon as she raised her eyes they rested on a high fair drapery by which smutches were put to shame and which had glided toward her over the grass without her noting its rustle. ", "She followed up its stiff sheen-up and up from the ground, where it had stopped-till at the end of a considerable journey her impression felt the shock of the fixed face which, surmounting it, seemed to offer the climax of the dressed condition. ", "\" Why mamma!\" ", "she cried the next instant-cried in a tone that, as she sprang to her feet, brought Sir Claude to his own beside her and gave her ladyship, a few yards off, the advantage of their momentary confusion. ", "Poor Maisie's was immense; ", "her mother's drop had the effect of one of the iron shutters that, in evening walks with Susan Ash, she had seen suddenly, at the touch of a spring, rattle down over shining shop-fronts. ", "The light of foreign travel was darkened at a stroke; ", "she had a horrible sense that they were caught; ", "and for the first time of her life in Ida's presence she so far translated an impulse into an invidious act as to clutch straight at the hand of her responsible confederate. ", "It didn't help her that he appeared at first equally hushed with horror; ", "a minute during which, in the empty garden, with its long shadows on the lawn, its blue sea over the hedge and its startled peace in the air, both her elders remained as stiff as tall tumblers filled to the brim and held straight for fear of a spill. ", "At last, in a tone that enriched the whole surprise by its unexpected softness, her mother said to Sir Claude: ", "Do you mind at all my speaking to her?\" ", "\"Oh no; ", "do you?\" ", "His reply was so long in coming that Maisie was the first to find the right note. ", "He laughed as he seemed to take it from her, and she felt a sufficient concession in his manner of addressing their visitor. ", "\" How in the world did you know we were here?\" ", "His wife, at this, came the rest of the way and sat down on the bench with a hand laid on her daughter, whom she gracefully drew to her and in whom, at her touch, the fear just kindled gave a second jump, but now in quite another direction. ", "Sir Claude, on the further side, resumed his seat and his newspapers, so that the three grouped themselves like a family party; ", "his connexion, in the oddest way in the world, almost cynically and in a flash acknowledged, and the mother patting the child into conformities unspeakable. ", "Maisie could already feel how little it was Sir Claude and she who were caught. ", "She had the positive sense of their catching their relative, catching her in the act of getting rid of her burden with a finality that showed her as unprecedentedly relaxed. ", "Oh yes, the fear had dropped, and she had never been so irrevocably parted with as in the pressure of possession now supremely exerted by Ida's long-gloved and much-bangled arm. ", "\" I went to the Regent's Park\"-this was presently her ladyship's answer to Sir Claude. ", "\"Do you mean to-day?\" ", "\"This morning, just after your own call there. ", "That's how I found you out; ", "that's what has brought me.\" ", "Sir Claude considered and Maisie waited. ", "Whom then did you see?\" ", "Ida gave a sound of indulgent mockery. ", "\" I like your scare. ", "I know your game. ", "I didn't see the person I risked seeing, but I had been ready to take my chance of her.\" ", "She addressed herself to Maisie; ", "she had encircled her more closely. ", "\" I asked for you, my dear, but I saw no one but a dirty parlourmaid. ", "She was red in the face with the great things that, as she told me, had just happened in the absence of her mistress; ", "and she luckily had the sense to have made out the place to which Sir Claude had come to take you. ", "If he hadn't given a false scent I should find you here: ", "that was the supposition on which I've proceeded.\" ", "Ida had never been so explicit about proceeding or supposing, and Maisie, drinking this in, noted too how Sir Claude shared her fine impression of it. ", "\" I wanted to see you,\" his wife continued, \"and now you can judge of the trouble I've taken. ", "I had everything to do in town to-day, but I managed to get off. ", "\" Maisie and her companion, for a moment, did justice to this achievement; ", "but Maisie was the first to express it. ", "\" I'm glad you wanted to see me, mamma.\" ", "Then after a concentration more deep and with a plunge more brave: ", "\"A little more ", "and you'd have been too late. ", "\" It stuck in her throat, but she brought it out: ", "\"We're going to France. ", "\" Ida was magnificent; ", "Ida kissed her on the forehead. ", "\" That's just what I thought likely; ", "it made me decide to run down. ", "I fancied that in spite of your scramble you'd wait to cross, and it added to the reason I have for seeing you. ", "Maisie wondered intensely what the reason could be, but she knew ever so much better than to ask. ", "She was slightly surprised indeed to perceive that Sir Claude didn't, and to hear him immediately enquire: ", "What in the name of goodness can you have to say to her?\" ", "His tone was not exactly rude, but it was impatient enough to make his wife's response a fresh specimen of the new softness. ", "\" That, my dear man, is all my own business.\" ", "\"Do you mean,\" Sir Claude asked, \"that you wish me to leave you with her?\" ", "\"Yes, if you'll be so good; ", "that's the extraordinary request I take the liberty of making. ", "Her ladyship had dropped to a mildness of irony by which, for a moment, poor Maisie was mystified and charmed, puzzled with a glimpse of something that in all the years had at intervals peeped out. ", "Ida smiled at Sir Claude with the strange air she had on such occasions of defying an interlocutor to keep it up as long; ", "her huge eyes, her red lips, the intense marks in her face formed an \u00e9clairage as distinct and public as a lamp set in a window. ", "The child seemed quite to see in it the very beacon that had lighted her path; ", "she suddenly found herself reflecting that it was no wonder the gentlemen were guided. ", "This must have been the way mamma had first looked at Sir Claude; ", "it brought back the lustre of the time they had outlived. ", "It must have been the way she looked also at Mr. Perriam and Lord Eric; ", "above all it contributed in Maisie's mind to a completer view of that satisfied state of the Captain. ", "Our young lady grasped this idea with a quick lifting of the heart; ", "there was a stillness during which her mother flooded her with a wealth of support to the Captain's striking tribute. ", "This stillness remained long enough unbroken to represent that Sir Claude too might but be gasping again under the spell originally strong for him; ", "so that Maisie quite hoped he would at least say something to show a recognition of how charming she could be. ", "What he presently said was: ", "Are you putting up for the night? ", "His wife cast grandly about. \" ", "Not here-I've come from Dover.\" ", "Over Maisie's head, at this, they still faced each other. ", "\" You spend the night there?\" ", "\"Yes, I brought some things. ", "I went to the hotel and hastily arranged; ", "then I caught the train that whisked me on here. ", "You see what a day I've had of it.\" ", "The statement may surprise, but these were really as obliging if not as lucid words as, into her daughter's ears at least, Ida's lips had ever dropped; ", "and there was a quick desire in the daughter that for the hour at any rate they should duly be welcomed as a ground of intercourse. ", "Certainly mamma had a charm which, when turned on, became a large explanation; ", "and the only danger now in an impulse to applaud it would be that of appearing to signalise its rarity. ", "Maisie, however, risked the peril in the geniality of an admission that Ida had indeed had a rush; ", "and she invited Sir Claude to expose himself by agreeing with her that the rush had been even worse than theirs. ", "He appeared to meet this appeal by saying with detachment enough: ", "\"You go back there to-night?\" ", "\"Oh yes-there are plenty of trains.\" ", "Again Sir Claude hesitated; ", "it would have been hard to say if the child, between them, more connected or divided them. ", "Then he brought out quietly: ", "It will be late for you to knock about. ", "I'll see you over.\" ", "\"You needn't trouble, thank you. ", "I think you won't deny that I can help myself and that it isn't the first time in my dreadful life that I've somehow managed it.\" ", "Save for this allusion to her dreadful life they talked there, Maisie noted, as if they were only rather superficial friends; ", "a special effect that she had often wondered at before in the midst of what she supposed to be intimacies. ", "This effect was augmented by the almost casual manner in which her ladyship went on: ", "\"I dare say I shall go abroad.\" ", "\"From Dover do you mean, straight?\" ", "\"How straight I can't say. ", "I'm excessively ill. ", "This for a minute struck Maisie as but a part of the conversation; ", "at the end of which time she became aware that it ought to strike her-though it apparently didn't strike Sir Claude-as a part of something graver. ", "It helped her to twist nearer. \" ", "Ill, mamma-really ill?\" ", "She regretted her \"really\" as soon as she had spoken it; ", "but there couldn't be a better proof of her mother's present polish than that Ida showed no gleam of a temper to take it up. ", "She had taken up at other times much tinier things. ", "She only pressed Maisie's head against her bosom and said: ", "Shockingly, my dear. ", "I must go to that new place.\" ", "\"What new place?\" ", "Sir Claude enquired. ", "Ida thought, but couldn't recall it. ", "\" Oh 'Chose,' don't you know?-where every one goes. ", "I want some proper treatment. ", "It's all I've ever asked for on earth. ", "But that's not what I came to say. ", "\" Sir Claude, in silence, folded one by one his newspapers; ", "then he rose and stood whacking the palm of his hand with the bundle. ", "\" You'll stop and dine with us?\" ", "\"Dear no-I can't dine at this sort of hour. ", "I ordered dinner at Dover. ", "Her ladyship's tone in this one instance showed a certain superiority to those conditions in which her daughter had artlessly found Folkestone a paradise. ", "It was yet not so crushing as to nip in the bud the eagerness with which the latter broke out: ", "But won't you at least have a cup of tea?\" ", "Ida kissed her again on the brow. ", "\" Thanks, love. ", "I had tea before coming. ", "\" She raised her eyes to Sir Claude. ", "\" She is sweet!\" ", "He made no more answer than if he didn't agree; ", "but Maisie was at ease about that and was still taken up with the joy of this happier pitch of their talk, which put more and more of a meaning into the Captain's version of her ladyship and literally kindled a conjecture that such an admirer might, over there at the other place, be waiting for her to dine. ", "Was the same conjecture in Sir Claude's mind? ", "He partly puzzled her, if it had risen there, by the slight perversity with which he returned to a question that his wife evidently thought she had disposed of. ", "He whacked his hand again with his paper. ", "\" I had really much better take you.\" ", "\"And leave Maisie here alone?\" ", "Mamma so clearly didn't want it that Maisie leaped at the vision of a Captain who had seen her on from Dover and who, while he waited to take her back, would be hovering just at the same distance at which, in Kensington Gardens, the companion of his walk had herself hovered. ", "Of course, however, instead of breathing any such guess she let Sir Claude reply; ", "all the more that his reply could contribute so much to her own present grandeur. ", "\" She won't be alone when she has a maid in attendance. ", "\" Maisie had never before had so much of a retinue, and she waited also to enjoy the action of it on her ladyship. ", "\" You mean the woman you brought from town?\" ", "Ida considered. ", "\" The person at the house spoke of her in a way that scarcely made her out company for my child.\" ", "Her tone was that her child had never wanted, in her hands, for prodigious company. ", "But she as distinctly continued to decline Sir Claude's. ", "\" Don't be an old goose,\" she said charmingly. ", "\" Let us alone.\" ", "In front of them on the grass he looked graver than Maisie at all now thought the occasion warranted. ", "\" I don't see why you can't say it before me.\" ", "His wife smoothed one of her daughter's curls. ", "\" Say what, dear?\" ", "\"Why what you came to say. ", "\" At this Maisie at last interposed: ", "she appealed to Sir Claude. ", "\" Do let her say it to me.\" ", "He looked hard for a moment at his little friend. ", "\" How do you know what she may say?\" ", "\"She must risk it,\" Ida remarked. ", "\"I only want to protect you,\" he continued to the child. ", "\"You want to protect yourself-that's what you mean,\" his wife replied. ", "\" Don't be afraid. ", "I won't touch you.\" ", "\"She won't touch you-she won't!\" ", "Maisie declared. ", "She felt by this time that she could really answer for it, and something of the emotion with which she had listened to the Captain came back to her. ", "It made her so happy and so secure that she could positively patronise mamma. ", "She did so in the Captain's very language. ", "\" She's good, she's good!\" ", "she proclaimed. ", "\"Oh Lord!\"-Sir Claude, at this, let himself go. ", "He appeared to have emitted some sound of derision that was smothered, to Maisie's ears, by her being again embraced by his wife. ", "Ida released her and held her off a little, looking at her with a very queer face. ", "Then the child became aware that their companion had left them and that from the face in question a confirmatory remark had proceeded. ", "\"I am good, love,\" said her ladyship. ", "XXI    ", "A good deal of the rest of Ida's visit was devoted to explaining, as it were, so extraordinary a statement. ", "This explanation was more copious than any she had yet indulged in, and as the summer twilight gathered and she kept her child in the garden she was conciliatory to a degree that let her need to arrange things a little perceptibly peep out. ", "It was not merely that she explained; ", "she almost conversed; ", "all that was wanting was that she should have positively chattered a little less. ", "It was really the occasion of Maisie's life on which her mother was to have most to say to her. ", "That alone was an implication of generosity and virtue, and no great stretch was required to make our young lady feel that she should best meet her and soonest have it over by simply seeming struck with the propriety of her contention. ", "They sat together while the parent's gloved hand sometimes rested sociably on the child's and sometimes gave a corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a tress too thick; ", "and Maisie was conscious of the effort to keep out of her eyes the wonder with which they were occasionally moved to blink. ", "Oh there would have been things to blink at if one had let one's self go; ", "and it was lucky they were alone together, without Sir Claude or Mrs. Wix or even Mrs. Beale to catch an imprudent glance. ", "Though profuse and prolonged her ladyship was not exhaustively lucid, and her account of her situation, so far as it could be called descriptive, was a muddle of inconsequent things, bruised fruit of an occasion she had rather too lightly affronted. ", "None of them were really thought out and some were even not wholly insincere. ", "It was as if she had asked outright what better proof could have been wanted of her goodness and her greatness than just this marvellous consent to give up what she had so cherished. ", "It was as if she had said in so many words: ", "\"There have been things between us-between Sir Claude and me-which I needn't go into, you little nuisance, because you wouldn't understand them. ", "\" It suited her to convey that Maisie had been kept, so far as she was concerned or could imagine, in a holy ignorance and that she must take for granted a supreme simplicity. ", "She turned this way and that in the predicament she had sought and from which she could neither retreat with grace nor emerge with credit: ", "she draped herself in the tatters of her impudence, postured to her utmost before the last little triangle of cracked glass to which so many fractures had reduced the polished plate of filial superstition. ", "If neither Sir Claude nor Mrs. Wix was there this was perhaps all the more a pity: ", "the scene had a style of its own that would have qualified it for presentation, especially at such a moment as that of her letting it betray that she quite did think her wretched offspring better placed with Sir Claude than in her own soiled hands. ", "There was at any rate nothing scant either in her admissions or her perversions, the mixture of her fear of what Maisie might undiscoverably think and of the support she at the same time gathered from a necessity of selfishness and a habit of brutality. ", "This habit flushed through the merit she now made, in terms explicit, of not having come to Folkestone to kick up a vulgar row. ", "She had not come to box any ears or to bang any doors or even to use any language: ", "she had come at the worst to lose the thread of her argument in an occasional dumb disgusted twitch of the toggery in which Mrs. Beale's low domestic had had the impudence to serve up Miss Farange. ", "She checked all criticism, not committing herself even so far as for those missing comforts of the schoolroom on which Mrs. Wix had presumed. ", "\"I am good-I'm crazily, I'm criminally good. ", "But it won't do for you any more, and if I've ceased to contend with him, and with you too, who have made most of the trouble between us, it's for reasons that you'll understand one of these days but too well-one of these days when I hope you'll know what it is to have lost a mother. ", "I'm awfully ill, but you mustn't ask me anything about it. ", "If I don't get off somewhere my doctor won't answer for the consequences. ", "He's stupefied at what I've borne-he says it has been put on me because I was formed to suffer. ", "I'm thinking of South Africa, but that's none of your business. ", "You must take your choice-you can't ask me questions if you're so ready to give me up. ", "No, I won't tell you; ", "you can find out for yourself. ", "South Africa's wonderful, they say, and if I do go it must be to give it a fair trial. ", "It must be either one thing or the other; ", "if he takes you, you know, he takes you. ", "I've struck my last blow for you; ", "I can follow you no longer from pillar to post. ", "I must live for myself at last, while there's still a handful left of me. ", "I'm very, very ill; ", "I'm very, very tired; ", "I'm very, very determined. ", "There you have it. ", "Make the most of it. ", "Your frock's too filthy; ", "but I came to sacrifice myself. ", "\" Maisie looked at the peccant places; ", "there were moments when it was a relief to her to drop her eyes even on anything so sordid. ", "All her interviews, all her ordeals with her mother had, as she had grown older, seemed to have, before any other, the hard quality of duration; ", "but longer than any, strangely, were these minutes offered to her as so pacific ", "and so agreeably winding up the connexion. ", "It was her anxiety that made them long, her fear of some hitch, some check of the current, one of her ladyship's famous quick jumps. ", "She held her breath; ", "she only wanted, by playing into her visitor's hands, to see the thing through. ", "But her impatience itself made at instants the whole situation swim; ", "there were things Ida said that she perhaps didn't hear, and there were things she heard that Ida perhaps didn't say. ", "\" You're all I have, and yet I'm capable of this. ", "Your father wishes you were dead-that, my dear, is what your father wishes. ", "You'll have to get used to it as I've done-I mean to his wishing that I'm dead. ", "At all events you see for yourself how wonderful I am to Sir Claude. ", "He wishes me dead quite as much; ", "and I'm sure that if making me scenes about you could have killed me-! ", "\" It was the mark of Ida's eloquence that she started more hares than she followed, and she gave but a glance in the direction of this one; ", "going on to say that the very proof of her treating her husband like an angel was that he had just stolen off not to be fairly shamed. ", "She spoke as if he had retired on tiptoe, as he might have withdrawn from a place of worship in which he was not fit to be present. ", "\" You'll never know what I've been through about you-never, never, never. ", "I spare you everything, as I always have; ", "though I dare say you know things that, if I did (I mean if I knew them) would make me-well, no matter! ", "You're old enough at any rate to know there are a lot of things I don't say that I easily might; ", "though it would do me good, I assure you, to have spoken my mind for once in my life. ", "I don't speak of your father's infamous wife: ", "that may give you a notion of the way I'm letting you off. ", "When I say 'you' I mean your precious friends and backers. ", "If you don't do justice to my forbearing, out of delicacy, to mention, just as a last word, about your stepfather, a little fact or two of a kind that really I should only have to mention to shine myself in comparison, and after every calumny, like pure gold: ", "if you don't do me that justice you'll never do me justice at all! ", "\" Maisie's desire to show what justice she did her had by this time become so intense as to have brought with it an inspiration. ", "The great effect of their encounter had been to confirm her sense of being launched with Sir Claude, to make it rich and full beyond anything she had dreamed, and everything now conspired to suggest that a single soft touch of her small hand would complete the good work and set her ladyship so promptly and majestically afloat as to leave the great seaway clear for the morrow. ", "This was the more the case as her hand had for some moments been rendered free by a marked man\u0153uvre of both of her mother's. ", "One of these capricious members had fumbled with visible impatience in some backward depth of drapery and had presently reappeared with a small article in its grasp. ", "The act had a significance for a little person trained, in that relation, from an early age, to keep an eye on manual motions, and its possible bearing was not darkened by the memory of the handful of gold that Susan Ash would never, never believe Mrs. Beale had sent back-\"not ", "she; ", "she's too false and too greedy!\"-to the munificent Countess. ", "To have guessed, none the less, that her ladyship's purse might be the real figure of the object extracted from the rustling covert at her rear-this suspicion gave on the spot to the child's eyes a direction carefully distant. ", "It added moreover to the optimism that for an hour could ruffle the surface of her deep diplomacy, ruffle it to the point of making her forget that she had never been safe unless she had also been stupid. ", "She in short forgot her habitual caution in her impulse to adopt her ladyship's practical interests and show her ladyship how perfectly she understood them. ", "She saw without looking that her mother pressed a little clasp; ", "heard, without wanting to, the sharp click that marked the closing portemonnaie from which something had been taken. ", "What this was she just didn't see; ", "it was not too substantial to be locked with ease in the fold of her ladyship's fingers. ", "Nothing was less new to Maisie than the art of not thinking singly, so that at this instant she could both bring out what was on her tongue's end and weigh, as to the object in her mother's palm, the question of its being a sovereign against the question of its being a shilling. ", "No sooner had she begun to speak than she saw that within a few seconds this question would have been settled: ", "she had foolishly checked the rising words of the little speech of presentation to which, under the circumstances, even such a high pride as Ida's had had to give some thought. ", "She had checked it completely-that was the next thing she felt: ", "the note she sounded brought into her companion's eyes a look that quickly enough seemed at variance with presentations. ", "\"That was what the Captain said to me that day, mamma. ", "I think it would have given you pleasure to hear the way he spoke of you. ", "The pleasure, Maisie could now in consternation reflect, would have been a long time coming if it had come no faster than the response evoked by her allusion to it. ", "Her mother gave her one of the looks that slammed the door in her face; ", "never in a career of unsuccessful experiments had Maisie had to take such a stare. ", "It reminded her of the way that once, at one of the lectures in Glower Street, something in a big jar that, amid an array of strange glasses and bad smells, had been promised as a beautiful yellow was produced as a beautiful black. ", "She had been sorry on that occasion for the lecturer, but she was at this moment sorrier for herself. ", "Oh nothing had ever made for twinges like mamma's manner of saying: ", "\"The Captain? ", "What Captain?\" ", "\"Why when we met you in the Gardens-the one who took me to sit with him. ", "That was exactly what he said. ", "\" Ida let it come on so far as to appear for an instant to pick up a lost thread. \" ", "What on earth did he say? ", "\" Maisie faltered supremely, but supremely she brought it out. ", "\" What you say, mamma-that you're so good.\" ", "\"What 'I' say?\" ", "Ida slowly rose, keeping her eyes on her child, and the hand that had busied itself in her purse conformed at her side and amid the folds of her dress to a certain stiffening of the arm. ", "\" I say you're a precious idiot, and I won't have you put words into my mouth!\" ", "This was much more peremptory than a mere contradiction. ", "Maisie could only feel on the spot that everything had broken short off and that their communication had abruptly ceased. ", "That was presently proved. ", "\" What business have you to speak to me of him?\" ", "Her daughter turned scarlet. ", "\" I thought you liked him.\" ", "\"Him!-the biggest cad in London! ", "Her ladyship towered again, and in the gathering dusk the whites of her eyes were huge. ", "Maisie's own, however, could by this time pretty well match them; ", "and she had at least now, with the first flare of anger that had ever yet lighted her face for a foe, the sense of looking up quite as hard as any one could look down. ", "Well, he was kind about you then; ", "he was, and it made me like him. ", "He said things-they were beautiful, they were, they were!\" ", "She was almost capable of the violence of forcing this home, for even in the midst of her surge of passion-of which in fact it was a part-there rose in her a fear, a pain, a vision ominous, precocious, of what it might mean for her mother's fate to have forfeited such a loyalty as that. ", "There was literally an instant in which Maisie fully saw-saw madness and desolation, saw ruin and darkness and death. ", "\" I've thought of him often since, and I hoped it was with him-with him-\" Here, in her emotion, it failed her, the breath of her filial hope. ", "But Ida got it out of her. ", "\" You hoped, you little horror-?\" ", "\"That it was he who's at Dover, that it was he who's to take you. ", "I mean to South Africa,\" Maisie said with another drop. ", "Ida's stupefaction, on this, kept her silent unnaturally long, so long that her daughter could not only wonder what was coming, but perfectly measure the decline of every symptom of her liberality. ", "She loomed there in her grandeur, merely dark and dumb; ", "her wrath was clearly still, as it had always been, a thing of resource and variety. ", "What Maisie least expected of it was by this law what now occurred. ", "It melted, in the summer twilight, gradually into pity, and the pity after a little found a cadence to which the renewed click of her purse gave an accent. ", "She had put back what she had taken out. ", "\" You're a dreadful dismal deplorable little thing,\" she murmured. ", "And with this she turned back and rustled away over the lawn. ", "After she had disappeared, Maisie dropped upon the bench again and for some time, in the empty garden and the deeper dusk, sat and stared at the image her flight had still left standing. ", "It had ceased to be her mother only, in the strangest way, that it might become her father, the father of whose wish that she were dead the announcement still lingered in the air. ", "It was a presence with vague edges-it continued to front her, to cover her. ", "But what reality that she need reckon with did it represent if Mr. Farange were, on his side, also going off-going off to America with the Countess, or even only to Spa? ", "That question had, from the house, a sudden gay answer in the great roar of a gong, and at the same moment she saw Sir Claude look out for her from the wide lighted doorway. ", "At this she went to him and he came forward and met her on the lawn. ", "For a minute she was with him there in silence as, just before, at the last, she had been with her mother. ", "\"She's gone?\" ", "\"She's gone. ", "\" Nothing more, for the instant, passed between them but to move together to the house, where, in the hall, he indulged in one of those sudden pleasantries with which, to the delight of his stepdaughter, his native animation overflowed. \" ", "Will Miss Farange do me the honour to accept my arm? ", "\" There was nothing in all her days that Miss Farange had accepted with such bliss, a bright rich element that floated them together to their feast; ", "before they reached which, however, she uttered, in the spirit of a glad young lady taken in to her first dinner, a sociable word that made him stop short. ", "She goes to South Africa.\" ", "\"To South Africa?\" ", "His face, for a moment, seemed to swing for a jump; ", "the next it took its spring into the extreme of hilarity. \" ", "Is that what she said?\" ", "\"Oh yes, I didn't mistake!\" ", "Maisie took to herself that credit. ", "For the climate. ", "Sir Claude was now looking at a young woman with black hair, a red frock and a tiny terrier tucked under her elbow. ", "She swept past them on her way to the dining-room, leaving an impression of a strong scent which mingled, amid the clatter of the place, with the hot aroma of food. ", "He had become a little graver; ", "he still stopped to talk. ", "\" I see-I see. ", "\" Other people brushed by; ", "he was not too grave to notice them. \" ", "Did she say anything else?\" ", "\"Oh yes, a lot more. ", "On this he met her eyes again with some intensity, but only repeating: ", "I see-I see. ", "\" Maisie had still her own vision, which she brought out.

", "\" She thought better of it. ", "Dear thrifty soul! ", "How much did she make by that man\u0153uvre? ", "Maisie considered. ", "\" I didn't see. ", "It was very small.\" ", "Sir Claude threw back his head. ", "Do you mean very little? ", "Sixpence? ", "Maisie resented this almost as if, at dinner, she were already bandying jokes with an agreeable neighbour. ", "\" It may have been a sovereign.\" ", "\"Or even,\" Sir Claude suggested, \"a ten-pound note. ", "\" She flushed at this sudden picture of what she perhaps had lost, and he made it more vivid by adding: ", "\"Rolled up in a tight little ball, you know-her way of treating banknotes as if they were curl-papers! ", "\" Maisie's flush deepened both with the immense plausibility of this and with a fresh wave of the consciousness that was always there to remind her of his cleverness-the consciousness of how immeasurably more after all he knew about mamma than she. ", "She had lived with her so many times without discovering the material of her curl-papers or assisting at any other of her dealings with banknotes. ", "The tight little ball had at any rate rolled away from her for ever-quite like one of the other balls that Ida's cue used to send flying. ", "Sir Claude gave her his arm again, and by the time she was seated at table she had perfectly made up her mind as to the amount of the sum she had forfeited. ", "Everything about her, however-the crowded room, the bedizened banquet, the savour of dishes, the drama of figures-ministered to the joy of life. ", "After dinner she smoked with her friend-for that was exactly what she felt she did-on a porch, a kind of terrace, where the red tips of cigars and the light dresses of ladies made, under the happy stars, a poetry that was almost intoxicating. ", "They talked but little, and she was slightly surprised at his asking for no more news of what her mother had said; ", "but she had no need of talk-there were a sense and a sound in everything to which words had nothing to add. ", "They smoked and smoked, and there was a sweetness in her stepfather's silence. ", "At last he said: ", "Let us take another turn-but you must go to bed soon. ", "Oh you know, we're going to have a system!\" ", "Their turn was back into the garden, along the dusky paths from which they could see the black masts and the red lights of boats and hear the calls and cries that evidently had to do with happy foreign travel; ", "and their system was once more to get on beautifully in this further lounge without a definite exchange. ", "Yet he finally spoke-he broke out as he tossed away the match from which he had taken a fresh light: ", "I must go for a stroll. ", "I'm in a fidget-I must walk it off. ", "\" She fell in with this as she fell in with everything; ", "on which he went on: ", "\"You go up to Miss Ash\"-it was the name they had started; ", "\"you must see she's not in mischief. ", "Can you find your way alone?\" ", "Oh yes; ", "I've been up and down seven times.\" ", "She positively enjoyed the prospect of an eighth. ", "Still they didn't separate; ", "they stood smoking together under the stars. ", "Then at last Sir Claude produced it. ", "\" I'm free-I'm free. ", "\" She looked up at him; ", "it was the very spot on which a couple of hours before she had looked up at her mother. ", "\" You're free-you're free.\" ", "\"To-morrow we go to France.

", "But he said nothing more; ", "he simply stooped a little and drew her to him-simply held her a little and kissed her goodnight; ", "after which, having given her a silent push upstairs to Miss Ash, he turned round again to the black masts and the red lights. ", "Maisie mounted as if France were at the top. ", "XXII    ", "The next day it seemed to her indeed at the bottom-down too far, in shuddering plunges, even to leave her a sense, on the Channel boat, of the height at which Sir Claude remained and which had never in every way been so great as when, much in the wet, though in the angle of a screen of canvas, he sociably sat with his stepdaughter's head in his lap and that of Mrs. Beale's housemaid fairly pillowed on his breast. ", "Maisie was surprised to learn as they drew into port that they had had a lovely passage; ", "but this emotion, at Boulogne, was speedily quenched in others, above all in the great ecstasy of a larger impression of life.

", "Literally in the course of an hour she found her initiation; ", "a consciousness much quickened by the superior part that, as soon as they had gobbled down a French breakfast-which was indeed a high note in the concert-she observed herself to play to Susan Ash. ", "Sir Claude, who had already bumped against people he knew and who, as he said, had business and letters, sent them out together for a walk, a walk in which the child was avenged, so far as poetic justice required, not only for the loud giggles that in their London trudges used to break from her attendant, but for all the years of her tendency to produce socially that impression of an excess of the queer something which had seemed to waver so widely between innocence and guilt. ", "On the spot, at Boulogne, though there might have been excess there was at least no wavering; ", "she recognised, she understood, she adored and took possession; ", "feeling herself attuned to everything and laying her hand, right and left, on what had simply been waiting for her. ", "She explained to Susan, she laughed at Susan, she towered over Susan; ", "and it was somehow Susan's stupidity, of which she had never yet been so sure, and Susan's bewilderment and ignorance and antagonism, that gave the liveliest rebound to her immediate perceptions and adoptions. ", "The place and the people were all a picture together, a picture that, when they went down to the wide sands, shimmered, in a thousand tints, with the pretty organisation of the plage, with the gaiety of spectators and bathers, with that of the language and the weather, and above all with that of our young lady's unprecedented situation. ", "For it appeared to her that no one since the beginning of time could have had such an adventure or, in an hour, so much experience; ", "as a sequel to which she only needed, in order to feel with conscious wonder how the past was changed, to hear Susan, inscrutably aggravated, express a preference for the Edgware Road. ", "The past was so changed and the circle it had formed already so overstepped that on that very afternoon, in the course of another walk, she found herself enquiring of Sir Claude-without a single scruple-if he were prepared as yet to name the moment at which they should start for Paris. ", "His answer, it must be said, gave her the least little chill. \" ", "Oh Paris, my dear child-I don't quite know about Paris!\" ", "This required to be met, but it was much less to challenge him than for the rich joy of her first discussion of the details of a tour that, after looking at him a minute, she replied: ", "Well, isn't that the real thing, the thing that when one does come abroad-?\" ", "He had turned grave again, and she merely threw that out: ", "it was a way of doing justice to the seriousness of their life. ", "She couldn't moreover be so much older since yesterday without reflecting that if by this time she probed a little he would recognise that she had done enough for mere patience. ", "There was in fact something in his eyes that suddenly, to her own, made her discretion shabby. ", "Before she could remedy this he had answered her last question, answered it in the way that, of all ways, she had least expected. ", "\" The thing it doesn't do not to do? ", "Certainly Paris is charming. ", "But, my dear fellow, Paris eats your head off. ", "I mean it's so beastly expensive. ", "That note gave her a pang-it suddenly let in a harder light. ", "Were they poor then, that is was he poor, really poor beyond the pleasantry of apollinaris and cold beef? ", "They had walked to the end of the long jetty that enclosed the harbour and were looking out at the dangers they had escaped, the grey horizon that was England, the tumbled surface of the sea and the brown smacks that bobbed upon it. ", "Why had he chosen an embarrassed time to make this foreign dash? ", "unless indeed it was just the dash economic, of which she had often heard and on which, after another look at the grey horizon and the bobbing boats, she was ready to turn round with elation. ", "She replied to him quite in his own manner: ", "I see, I see. ", "\" She smiled up at him. ", "\" Our affairs are involved.\" ", "\"That's it.\" ", "He returned her smile. ", "\" Mine are not quite so bad as yours; ", "for yours are really, my dear man, in a state I can't see through at all. ", "But mine will do-for a mess.\" ", "She thought this over. \" ", "But isn't France cheaper than England?\" ", "England, over there in the thickening gloom, looked just then remarkably dear. ", "\" I dare say; ", "some parts.\" ", "\"Then can't we live in those parts?\" ", "There was something that for an instant, in satisfaction of this, he had the air of being about to say and yet not saying. ", "What he presently said was: ", "This very place is one of them.\" ", "\"Then we shall live here?\" ", "He didn't treat it quite so definitely as she liked. ", "\" Since we've come to save money!\" ", "This made her press him more. ", "\" How long shall we stay?\" ", "\"Oh three or four days. ", "\" It took her breath away. ", "\" You can save money in that time?\" ", "He burst out laughing, starting to walk again and taking her under his arm. ", "He confessed to her on the way that she too had put a finger on the weakest of all his weaknesses, the fact, of which he was perfectly aware, that he probably might have lived within his means if he had never done anything for thrift. ", "\" It's the happy thoughts that do it,\" he said; ", "\"there's nothing so ruinous as putting in a cheap week. ", "\" Maisie heard afresh among the pleasant sounds of the closing day that steel click of Ida's change of mind. ", "She thought of the ten-pound note it would have been delightful at this juncture to produce for her companion's encouragement. ", "But the idea was dissipated by his saying irrelevantly, in presence of the next thing they stopped to admire: ", "We shall stay till she arrives. ", "\" She turned upon him. \" ", "Mrs. Beale?\" ", "\"Mrs. Wix. ", "I've had a wire,\" he went on. \" ", "She has seen your mother.\" ", "\"Seen mamma?\" ", "Maisie stared.

", "\" Then she hasn't gone?\" ", "\"Your mother?-to South Africa? ", "I give it up, dear boy,\" Sir Claude said; ", "and she seemed literally to see him give it up as he stood there and with a kind of absent gaze-absent, that is, from her affairs-followed the fine stride and shining limbs of a young fishwife who had just waded out of the sea with her basketful of shrimps. ", "His thought came back to her sooner than his eyes. ", "\" But I dare say it's all right. ", "She wouldn't come if it wasn't, poor old thing: ", "she knows rather well what she's about. ", "\" This was so reassuring that Maisie, after turning it over, could make it fit into her dream. \" ", "Well, what is she about?\" ", "He finally stopped looking at the fishwife-he met his companion's enquiry. ", "\" Oh you know! ", "\" There was something in the way he said it that made, between them, more of an equality than she had yet imagined; ", "but it had also more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down, and what it did with her was shown by the sound of her assent. ", "\"Yes-I know! ", "\" What she knew, what she could know is by this time no secret to us: ", "it grew and grew at any rate, the rest of that day, in the air of what he took for granted. ", "It was better he should do that than attempt to test her knowledge; ", "but there at the worst was the gist of the matter: ", "it was open between them at last that their great change, as, speaking as if it had already lasted weeks, Maisie called it, was somehow built up round Mrs. Wix. ", "Before she went to bed that night she knew further that Sir Claude, since, as he called it, they had been on the rush, had received more telegrams than one. ", "But they separated again without speaking of Mrs. Beale. ", "Oh what a crossing for the straighteners and the old brown dress-which latter appurtenance the child saw thriftily revived for the possible disasters of travel! ", "The wind got up in the night and from her little room at the inn Maisie could hear the noise of the sea. ", "The next day it was raining and everything different: ", "this was the case even with Susan Ash, who positively crowed over the bad weather, partly, it seemed, for relish of the time their visitor would have in the boat, and partly to point the moral of the folly of coming to such holes. ", "In the wet, with Sir Claude, Maisie went to the Folkestone packet, on the arrival of which, with many signs of the fray, he made her wait under an umbrella by the quay; ", "whence almost ere the vessel touched, he was to be descried, in quest of their friend, wriggling-that had been his word-through the invalids massed upon the deck. ", "It was long till he reappeared-it was not indeed till every one had landed; ", "when he presented the object of his benevolence in a light that Maisie scarce knew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of triumph. ", "The lady on his arm, still bent beneath her late ordeal, was muffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support to so much woe. ", "At the hotel, an hour later, this ambiguity dropped: ", "assisting Mrs. Wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself, Maisie heard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if Sir Claude hadn't put it in her power. ", "It was a phrase that in her room she repeated in connexions indescribable: ", "he had put it in her power to have \"changes,\" as she said, of the most intimate order, adapted to climates and occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of a vast itinerary. ", "Cheap weeks would of course be in their place after so much money spent on a governess; ", "sums not grudged, however, by this lady's pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through the straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified. ", "Sir Claude in truth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix's; ", "and moreover she would rather be in her own shoes than in her friend's creaking new ones in the event of an encounter with Mrs. Beale. ", "Maisie was too lost in the idea of Mrs. Beale's judgement of so much newness to pass any judgement herself. ", "Besides, after much luncheon and many endearments, the question took quite another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure of the child's quick view that there were other eyes than Susan Ash's to open to what she could show. ", "She couldn't show much, alas, till it stopped raining, which it declined to do that day; ", "but this had only the effect of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix's own demonstration. ", "It came as they sat in the little white and gold salon which Maisie thought the loveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the Countess; ", "it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and blew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and cigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning back, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy little chimney. ", "It came in spite of something that could only be named his air of wishing to put it off; ", "an air that had served him-oh as all his airs served him!-to the extent of his having for a couple of hours confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it on the level of the little empty coffee-cups and petits verres (Mrs. Wix had two of each!) ", "that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the French fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they were launched. ", "She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs. Wix had told her, that what this lady had come over for was not merely to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; ", "not even to hear Sir Claude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds emitted by the English folk at the hotel. ", "It was perhaps half an effect of her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody's else: ", "she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour, of a redness associated in Maisie's mind at that pitch either with measles or with \"habits.\" ", "Her heart was not at all in the gossip about Boulogne; ", "and if her complexion was partly the result of the d\u00e9jeuner and the petits verres it was also the brave signal of what she was there to say. ", "Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been awaited by the youngest member of the party. ", "Her ladyship packed me off-she almost put me into the cab! ", "\" That was what Mrs. Wix at last brought out. ", "XXIII   Sir Claude was stationed at the window; ", "he didn't so much as turn round, and it was left to the youngest of the three to take up the remark. ", "\" Do you mean you went to see her yesterday?\" ", "\"She came to see me. ", "She knocked at my shabby door. ", "She mounted my squalid stair. ", "She told me she had seen you at Folkestone.\" ", "Maisie wondered. ", "\" She went back that evening?\" ", "\"No; ", "yesterday morning. ", "She drove to me straight from the station. ", "It was most remarkable. ", "If I had a job to get off she did nothing to make it worse-she did a great deal to make it better.\" ", "Mrs. Wix hung fire, though the flame in her face burned brighter; ", "then she became capable of saying: ", "Her ladyship's kind! ", "She did what I didn't expect. ", "\" Maisie, on this, looked straight at her stepfather's back; ", "it might well have been for her at that hour a monument of her ladyship's kindness. ", "It remained, as such, monumentally still, and for a time that permitted the child to ask of their companion: ", "Did she really help you?\" ", "\"Most practically.\" ", "Again Mrs. Wix paused; ", "again she quite resounded. ", "\" She gave me a ten-pound note. ", "\" At that, still looking out, Sir Claude, at the window, laughed loud. \" ", "So you see, Maisie, we've not quite lost it!\" ", "\"Oh no,\" Maisie responded. \" ", "Isn't that too charming?\" ", "She smiled at Mrs. Wix. ", "\" We know all about it.\" ", "Then on her friend's showing such blankness as was compatible with such a flush she pursued: ", "\"She does want me to have you?\" ", "Mrs. Wix showed a final hesitation, which, however, while Sir Claude drummed on the window-pane, she presently surmounted. ", "It came to Maisie that in spite of his drumming and of his not turning round he was really so much interested as to leave himself in a manner in her hands; ", "which somehow suddenly seemed to her a greater proof than he could have given by interfering. ", "\" She wants me to have you!\" ", "Mrs. Wix declared. ", "Maisie answered this bang at Sir Claude. ", "\" Then that's nice for all of us.\" ", "Of course it was, his continued silence sufficiently admitted while Mrs. Wix rose from her chair and, as if to take more of a stand, placed herself, not without majesty, before the fire. ", "The incongruity of her smartness, the circumference of her stiff frock, presented her as really more ready for Paris than any of them. ", "She also gazed hard at Sir Claude's back. \" ", "Your wife was different from anything she had ever shown me. ", "She recognises certain proprieties.\" ", "\"Which? ", "Do you happen to remember?\" ", "Sir Claude asked. ", "Mrs. Wix's reply was prompt. ", "\" The importance for Maisie of a gentlewoman, of some one who's not-well, so bad! ", "She objects to a mere maid, and I don't in the least mind telling you what she wants me to do. ", "\" One thing was clear-Mrs. Wix was now bold enough for anything. \" ", "She wants me to persuade you to get rid of the person from Mrs. Beale's. ", "\" Maisie waited for Sir Claude to pronounce on this; ", "then she could only understand that he on his side waited, and she felt particularly full of common sense as she met her responsibility. ", "\" Oh I don't want Susan with you!\" ", "she said to Mrs. Wix. ", "Sir Claude, always from the window, approved. ", "\" That's quite simple. ", "I'll take her back.\" ", "Mrs. Wix gave a positive jump; ", "Maisie caught her look of alarm. ", "\"' Take' her? ", "You don't mean to go over on purpose?\" ", "Sir Claude said nothing for a moment; ", "after which, \"Why shouldn't I leave you here?\" ", "he enquired. ", "Maisie, at this, sprang up. ", "\" Oh do, oh do, oh do!\" ", "The next moment she was interlaced with Mrs. Wix, and the two, on the hearth-rug, their eyes in each other's eyes, considered the plan with intensity. ", "Then Maisie felt the difference of what they saw in it. ", "\"She can surely go back alone: ", "why should you put yourself out?\" ", "Mrs. Wix demanded. ", "\"Oh she's an idiot-she's incapable. ", "If anything should happen to her it would be awkward: ", "it was I who brought her-without her asking. ", "If I turn her away I ought with my own hand to place her again exactly where I found her.\" ", "Mrs. Wix's face appealed to Maisie on such folly, and her manner, as directed to their companion, had, to her pupil's surprise, an unprecedented firmness. ", "\" Dear Sir Claude, I think you're perverse. ", "Pay her fare and give her a sovereign. ", "She has had an experience that she never dreamed of and that will be an advantage to her through life. ", "If she goes wrong on the way it will be simply because she wants to, and, with her expenses and her remuneration-make it even what you like!-you'll have treated her as handsomely as you always treat every one. ", "\" This was a new tone-as new as Mrs. Wix's cap; ", "and it could strike a young person with a sharpened sense for latent meanings as the upshot of a relation that had taken on a new character. ", "It brought out for Maisie how much more even than she had guessed her friends were fighting side by side. ", "At the same time it needed so definite a justification that as Sir Claude now at last did face them she at first supposed him merely resentful of excessive familiarity. ", "She was therefore yet more puzzled to see him show his serene beauty untroubled, as well as an equal interest in a matter quite distinct from any freedom but her ladyship's. \" ", "Did my wife come alone?\" ", "He could ask even that good-humouredly. ", "\"When she called on me?\" ", "Mrs. Wix was red now: ", "his good humour wouldn't keep down her colour, which for a minute glowed there like her ugly honesty. \" ", "No-there was some one in the cab. ", "\" The only attenuation she could think of was after a minute to add: ", "But they didn't come up.\" ", "Sir Claude broke into a laugh-Maisie herself could guess what it was at: ", "while he now walked about, still laughing, and at the fireplace gave a gay kick to a displaced log, she felt more vague about almost everything than about the drollery of such a \"they.\" ", "She in fact could scarce have told you if it was to deepen or to cover the joke that she bethought herself to observe: ", "Perhaps it was her maid. ", "Mrs. Wix gave her a look that at any rate deprecated the wrong tone. ", "\" It was not her maid.\" ", "\"Do you mean there are this time two?\" ", "Sir Claude asked as if he hadn't heard. ", "\"Two maids? ", "\" Maisie went on as if she might assume he had. ", "The reproach of the straighteners darkened; ", "but Sir Claude cut across it with a sudden: ", "See here; ", "what do you mean? ", "And what do you suppose she meant?\" ", "Mrs. Wix let him for a moment, in silence, understand that the answer to his question, if he didn't take care, might give him more than he wanted. ", "It was as if, with this scruple, she measured and adjusted all she gave him in at last saying: ", "\"What she meant was to make me know that you're definitely free. ", "To have that straight from her was a joy I of course hadn't hoped for: ", "it made the assurance, and my delight at it, a thing I could really proceed upon. ", "You already know now certainly I'd have started even if she hadn't pressed me; ", "you already know what, so long, we've been looking for and what, as soon as she told me of her step taken at Folkestone, I recognised with rapture that we have. ", "It's your freedom that makes me right\"-she fairly bristled with her logic. \" ", "But I don't mind telling you that it's her action that makes me happy!\" ", "\"Her action?\" ", "Sir Claude echoed. ", "\" Why, my dear woman, her action is just a hideous crime. ", "It happens to satisfy our sympathies in a way that's quite delicious; ", "but that doesn't in the least alter the fact that it's the most abominable thing ever done. ", "She has chucked our friend here overboard not a bit less than if she had shoved her shrieking and pleading, out of that window and down two floors to the paving-stones. ", "\" Maisie surveyed serenely the parties to the discussion. ", "\" Oh your friend here, dear Sir Claude, doesn't plead and shriek!\" ", "He looked at her a moment. ", "Never. ", "Never.

", "\" Maisie could feel again how a certain rude rightness in this plea might have been found exasperating; ", "but as she had often watched Sir Claude in apprehension of displeasures that didn't come, so now, instead of saying \"Oh hell!\" as her father used, she observed him only to take refuge in a question that at the worst was abrupt. ", "\"Who is it this time, do you know?\" ", "Mrs. Wix tried blind dignity. ", "\" Who is what, Sir Claude?\" ", "\"The man who stands the cabs. ", "Who was in the one that waited at your door?\" ", "At this challenge she faltered so long that her young friend's pitying conscience gave her a hand. ", "\" It wasn't the Captain.

", "\" I mean before Maisie.\" ", "Sir Claude laughed again. ", "\" Why she can't hurt him!\" ", "Maisie felt herself, as it passed, brushed by the light humour of this. ", "Yes, I can't hurt him. ", "\" The straighteners again roofed her over; ", "after which they seemed to crack with the explosion of their wearer's honesty. ", "Amid the flying splinters Mrs. Wix produced a name. \" ", "Mr. Tischbein. ", "\" There was for an instant a silence that, under Sir Claude's influence and while he and Maisie looked at each other, suddenly pretended to be that of gravity.

", "\" It was time!\" ", "Then as if still more to point the moral: ", "I said just now I understood your wife. ", "I said just now I admired her. ", "I stand to it: ", "I did both of those things when I saw how even she, poor thing, saw. ", "If you want the dots on the i's you shall have them. ", "What she came to me for, in spite of everything, was that I'm just\"-she quavered it out-\"well, just clean! ", "What she saw for her daughter was that there must at last be a decent person! ", "\" Maisie was quick enough to jump a little at the sound of this implication that such a person was what Sir Claude was not; ", "the next instant, however, she more profoundly guessed against whom the discrimination was made.

", "It's to save you from the worst person of all. ", "I haven't, after all, come over to be afraid to speak of her! ", "That's the person in whose place her ladyship wants such a person as even me; ", "and if she thought herself, as she as good as told me, not fit for Maisie's company, it's not, as you may well suppose, that she may make room for Mrs. Beale! ", "\" Maisie watched his face as it took this outbreak, and the most she saw in it was that it turned a little white.

", "She has great merits of her own.\" ", "Mrs. Wix, at this, instead of immediately replying, did what Sir Claude had been doing before: ", "she moved across to the window and stared a while into the storm.

", "Sir Claude, in spite of these things, glanced about for his hat; ", "on which Maisie spied it first and, making a dash for it, held it out to him. ", "He took it with a gleam of a \"thank-you\" in his face, and then something moved her still to hold the other side of the brim; ", "so that, united by their grasp of this object, they stood some seconds looking many things at each other. ", "By this time Mrs. Wix had turned round. \" ", "Do you mean to tell me,\" she demanded, \"that you are going back?\" ", "\"To Mrs. Beale?

", "\" All the air in France, Sir Claude, won't, I think, give you the courage to deny that you're simply afraid of her! ", "Oh this time he did look queer; ", "Maisie had no need of Susan's vocabulary to note it!

", "Resting on Maisie's, though for ever so short a time, there was something they gave up to her and tried to explain. ", "His lips, however, explained nothing; ", "they only surrendered to Mrs. Wix. ", "Yes. ", "I'm simply afraid of her!\" ", "He opened the door and passed out. ", "It brought back to Maisie his confession of fear of her mother; ", "it made her stepmother then the second lady about whom he failed of the particular virtue that was supposed most to mark a gentleman. ", "In fact there were three of them, if she counted in Mrs. Wix, before whom he had undeniably quailed. ", "Well, his want of valour was but a deeper appeal to her tenderness. ", "To thrill with response to it she had only to remember all the ladies she herself had, as they called it, funked. ", "XXIV    ", "It continued to rain so hard that our young lady's private dream of explaining the Continent to their visitor had to contain a provision for some adequate treatment of the weather. ", "At the table d'h\u00f4te that evening she threw out a variety of lights: ", "this was the second ceremony of the sort she had sat through, and she would have neglected her privilege and dishonoured her vocabulary-which indeed consisted mainly of the names of dishes-if she had not been proportionately ready to dazzle with interpretations. ", "Preoccupied and overawed, Mrs. Wix was apparently dim: ", "she accepted her pupil's version of the mysteries of the menu in a manner that might have struck the child as the depression of a credulity conscious not so much of its needs as of its dimensions. ", "Maisie was soon enough-though it scarce happened before bedtime-confronted again with the different sort of programme for which she reserved her criticism. ", "They remounted together to their sitting-room while Sir Claude, who said he would join them later, remained below to smoke and to converse with the old acquaintances that he met wherever he turned. ", "He had proposed his companions, for coffee, the enjoyment of the salon de lecture, but Mrs. Wix had replied promptly and with something of an air that it struck her their own apartments offered them every convenience. ", "They offered the good lady herself, Maisie could immediately observe, not only that of this rather grand reference, which, already emulous, so far as it went, of her pupil, she made as if she had spent her life in salons; ", "but that of a stiff French sofa where she could sit and stare at the faint French lamp, in default of the French clock that had stopped, as for some account of the time Sir Claude would so markedly interpose. ", "Her demeanour accused him so directly of hovering beyond her reach that Maisie sought to divert her by a report of Susan's quaint attitude on the matter of their conversation after lunch. ", "Maisie had mentioned to the young woman for sympathy's sake the plan for her relief, but her disapproval of alien ways appeared, strange to say, only to prompt her to hug her gloom; ", "so that between Mrs. Wix's effect of displacing her and the visible stiffening of her back the child had the sense of a double office and enlarged play for pacific powers. ", "These powers played to no great purpose, it was true, in keeping before Mrs. Wix the vision of Sir Claude's perversity, which hung there in the pauses of talk and which he himself, after unmistakeable delays, finally made quite lurid by bursting in-it was near ten o'clock-with an object held up in his hand. ", "She knew before he spoke what it was; ", "she knew at least from the underlying sense of all that, since the hour spent after the Exhibition with her father, had not sprung up to reinstate Mr. Farange-she knew it meant a triumph for Mrs. Beale. ", "The mere present sight of Sir Claude's face caused her on the spot to drop straight through her last impression of Mr. Farange a plummet that reached still deeper down than the security of these days of flight.

", "But if the object in Sir Claude's hand revealed itself as a letter which he held up very high, so there was something in his mere motion that laid Mrs. Beale again bare.

", "\" She ought to put it straight in the fire.\" ", "\"My dear woman, she's not such a fool! ", "It's much too precious.\" ", "He had picked the letter up and he gave it again a glance of complacency which produced a light in his face. ", "\" Such a document\"-he considered, then concluded with a slight drop-\"such a document is, in fine, a basis!\" ", "\"A basis for what?\" ", "\"Well-for proceedings.\" ", "\"Hers?\" ", "Mrs. Wix's voice had become outright the voice of derision.

", "It's just your want of the power that makes the scandal of your connexion with her. ", "Therefore it's just her want of it that makes that of hers with you. ", "That's all I contend!\" ", "Mrs. Wix concluded with an unparalleled neigh of battle. ", "Oh she did know what she was talking about!

", "Before Maisie could commit herself, however, the ground was occupied by Sir Claude, who, as he stood before their visitor with an expression half rueful, half persuasive, rubbed his hand sharply up and down the back of his head. ", "\" Then why the deuce do you grant so-do you, I may even say, rejoice so-that by the desertion of my own precious partner I'm free?\" ", "Mrs. Wix met this challenge first with silence, then with a demonstration the most extraordinary, the most unexpected.

", "\" I don't think I ought to be bad to Mrs. Beale. ", "She heard, on this, a deep sound, something inarticulate and sweet, from Sir Claude; ", "but tears were what Mrs. Wix didn't scruple to show. \" ", "Do you think you ought to be bad to me?\" ", "The question was the more disconcerting that Mrs. Wix's emotion didn't deprive her of the advantage of her effect. ", "\" If you see that woman again you're lost!\" ", "she declared to their companion. ", "Sir Claude looked at the moony globe of the lamp; ", "he seemed to see for an instant what seeing Mrs. Beale would consist of. ", "It was also apparently from this vision that he drew strength to return: ", "Her situation, by what has happened, is completely changed; ", "and it's no use your trying to prove to me that I needn't take any account of that.\" ", "\"If you see that woman you're lost!\" ", "Mrs. Wix with greater force repeated. ", "\"Do you think she'll not let me come back to you?

", "\" Maisie could only answer for the impression on herself, though indeed from the heart even of Mrs. Wix's rigour there floated to her sense a faint fragrance of depraved concession. ", "Maisie had her dumb word for the show such a speech could make, for the irresistible charm it could take from his dazzling sincerity; ", "and before she could do anything but blink at excess of light she heard this very word sound on Mrs. Wix's lips, just as if the poor lady had guessed it and wished, snatching it from her, to blight it like a crumpled flower. ", "\" You're dreadful, you're terrible, for you know ", "but too well that it's not a small thing to me that you should address me in terms that are princely!\" ", "Princely was what he stood there and looked and sounded; ", "that was what Maisie for the occasion found herself reduced to simple worship of him for being. ", "Yet strange to say too, as Mrs. Wix went on, an echo rang within her that matched the echo she had herself just produced. ", "\" How much you must want to see her to say such things as that and to be ready to do so much for the poor little likes of Maisie and me! ", "She has a hold on you, and you know it, and you want to feel it again and-God knows, or at least I do, what's your motive and desire-enjoy it once more and give yourself up to it! ", "It doesn't matter if it's one day or three: ", "enough is as good as a feast and the lovely time you'll have with her is something you're willing to pay for! ", "I dare say you'd like me to believe that your pay is to get her to give you up; ", "but that's a matter on which I strongly urge you not to put down your money in advance. ", "Give her up first. ", "Then pay her what you please!\" ", "Sir Claude took this to the end, though there were things in it that made him colour, called into his face more of the apprehension than Maisie had ever perceived there of a particular sort of shock. ", "She had an odd sense that it was the first time she had seen any one but Mrs. Wix really and truly scandalised, and this fed her inference, which grew and grew from moment to moment, that Mrs. Wix was proving more of a force to reckon with than either of them had allowed so much room for. ", "It was true that, long before, she had obtained a \"hold\" of him, as she called it, different in kind from that obtained by Mrs. Beale and originally by her ladyship. ", "But Maisie could quite feel with him now that he had really not expected this advantage to be driven so home. ", "Oh they hadn't at all got to where Mrs. Wix would stop, for the next minute she was driving harder than ever. ", "It was the result of his saying with a certain dryness, though so kindly that what most affected Maisie in it was his patience: ", "My dear friend, it's simply a matter in which I must judge for myself. ", "You've judged for me, I know, a good deal, of late, in a way that I appreciate, I assure you, down to the ground. ", "But you can't do it always; ", "no one can do that for another, don't you see, in every case. ", "There are exceptions, particular cases that turn up and that are awfully delicate. ", "It would be too easy if I could shift it all off on you: ", "it would be allowing you to incur an amount of responsibility that I should simply become quite ashamed of. ", "You'll find, I'm sure, that you'll have quite as much as you'll enjoy if you'll be so good as to accept the situation as circumstances happen to make it for you and to stay here with our friend, till I rejoin you, on the footing of as much pleasantness and as much comfort-and I think I have a right to add, to both of you, of as much faith in me-as possible. ", "Oh he was princely indeed: ", "that came out more and more with every word he said and with the particular way he said it, and Maisie could feel his monitress stiffen almost with anguish against the increase of his spell and then hurl herself as a desperate defence from it into the quite confessed poorness of violence, of iteration. ", "\" You're afraid of her-afraid, afraid, afraid! ", "Oh dear, ", "oh dear, oh dear!\" ", "Mrs. Wix wailed it with a high quaver, then broke down into a long shudder of helplessness and woe. ", "The next minute she had flung herself again on the lean sofa and had burst into a passion of tears. ", "Sir Claude stood and looked at her a moment; ", "he shook his head slowly, altogether tenderly. ", "\" I've already admitted it-I'm in mortal terror; ", "so we'll let that settle the question. ", "I think you had best go to bed,\" he added; ", "you've had a tremendous day and you must both be tired to death. ", "I shall not expect you to concern yourselves in the morning with my movements. ", "There's an early boat on; ", "I shall have cleared out before you're up; ", "and I shall moreover have dealt directly and most effectively, I assure you, with the haughty but not quite hopeless Miss Ash. ", "He turned to his stepdaughter as if at once to take leave of her and give her a sign of how, through all tension and friction, they were still united in such a way that she at least needn't worry. ", "Maisie boy!\"-he opened his arms to her. ", "With her culpable lightness she flew into them and, while he kissed her, chose the soft method of silence to satisfy him, the silence that after battles of talk was the best balm she could offer his wounds. ", "They held each other long enough to reaffirm intensely their vows; ", "after which they were almost forced apart by Mrs. Wix's jumping to her feet. ", "Her jump, either with a quick return or with a final lapse of courage, was also to supplication almost abject. ", "\" I beseech you not to take a step so miserable and so fatal. ", "I know her ", "but too well, even if you jeer at me for saying it; ", "little as I've seen her ", "I know her, I know her. ", "I know what she'll do-I see it as I stand here. ", "Since you're afraid of her it's the mercy of heaven. ", "Don't, for God's sake, be afraid to show it, to profit by it and to arrive at the very safety that it gives you. ", "I'm not afraid of her, I assure you; ", "you must already have seen for yourself that there's nothing I'm afraid of now. ", "Let me go to her-I'll settle her ", "and I'll take that woman back without a hair of her touched. ", "Let me put in the two or three days-let me wind up the connexion. ", "You stay here with Maisie, with the carriage and the larks and the luxury; ", "then I'll return to you and we'll go off together-we'll live together without a cloud. ", "Take me, take me,\" she went on and on-the tide of her eloquence was high. ", "\" Here I am; ", "I know what I am and what I ain't; ", "but I say boldly to the face of you both that I'll do better for you, far, than ever she'll even try to. ", "I say it to yours, Sir Claude, even though I owe you the very dress on my back and the very shoes on my feet. ", "I owe you everything-that's just the reason; ", "and to pay it back, in profusion, what can that be but what I want? ", "Here I am, here I am!\"-she spread herself into an exhibition that, combined with her intensity and her decorations, appeared to suggest her for strange offices and devotions, for ridiculous replacements and substitutions. ", "She manipulated her gown as she talked, she insisted on the items of her debt. ", "\" I have nothing of my own, I know-no money, no clothes, no appearance, no anything, nothing but my hold of this little one truth, which is all in the world I can bribe you with: ", "that the pair of you are more to me than all besides, and that if you'll let me help you and save you, make what you both want possible in the one way it can be, why, I'll work myself to the bone in your service!\" ", "Sir Claude wavered there without an answer to this magnificent appeal; ", "he plainly cast about for one, and in no small agitation and pain. ", "He addressed himself in his quest, however, only to vague quarters until he met again, as he so frequently and actively met it, the more than filial gaze of his intelligent little charge. ", "That gave him-poor plastic and dependent male-his issue. ", "If she was still a child she was yet of the sex that could help him out. ", "He signified as much by a renewed invitation to an embrace. ", "She freshly sprang to him and again they inaudibly conversed. \" ", "Be nice to her, be nice to her,\" he at last distinctly articulated; ", "\"be nice to her as you've not even been to me!\" ", "On which, without another look at Mrs. Wix, he somehow got out of the room, leaving Maisie under the slight oppression of these words as well as of the idea that he had unmistakeably once more dodged. ", "XXV    ", "Every single thing he had prophesied came so true that it was after all no more than fair to expect quite as much for what he had as good as promised. ", "His pledges they could verify to the letter, down to his very guarantee that a way would be found with Miss Ash. ", "Roused in the summer dawn and vehemently squeezed by that interesting exile, Maisie fell back upon her couch with a renewed appreciation of his policy, a memento of which, when she rose later on to dress, glittered at her from the carpet in the shape of a sixpence that had overflowed from Susan's pride of possession. ", "Sixpences really, for the forty-eight hours that followed, seemed to abound in her life; ", "she fancifully computed the number of them represented by such a period of \"larks.\" ", "The number was not kept down, she presently noticed, by any scheme of revenge for Sir Claude's flight which should take on Mrs. Wix's part the form of a refusal to avail herself of the facilities he had so bravely ordered. ", "It was in fact impossible to escape them; ", "it was in the good lady's own phrase ridiculous to go on foot when you had a carriage prancing at the door. ", "Everything about them pranced: ", "the very waiters even as they presented the dishes to which, from a similar sense of the absurdity of perversity, Mrs. Wix helped herself with a freedom that spoke to Maisie quite as much of her depletion as of her logic. ", "Her appetite was a sign to her companion of a great many things and testified no less on the whole to her general than to her particular condition. ", "She had arrears of dinner to make up, and it was touching that in a dinnerless state her moral passion should have burned so clear. ", "She partook largely as a refuge from depression, and yet the opportunity to partake was just a mark of the sinister symptoms that depressed her. ", "The affair was in short a combat, in which the baser element triumphed, between her refusal to be bought off and her consent to be clothed and fed. ", "It was not at any rate to be gainsaid that there was comfort for her in the developments of France; ", "comfort so great as to leave Maisie free to take with her all the security for granted and brush all the danger aside. ", "That was the way to carry out in detail Sir Claude's injunction to be \"nice\"; ", "that was the way, as well, to look, with her, in a survey of the pleasures of life abroad, straight over the head of any doubt. ", "They shrank at last, all doubts, as the weather cleared up: ", "it had an immense effect on them and became quite as lovely as Sir Claude had engaged. ", "This seemed to have put him so into the secret of things, and the joy of the world so waylaid the steps of his friends, that little by little the spirit of hope filled the air and finally took possession of the scene. ", "To drive on the long cliff was splendid, but it was perhaps better still to creep in the shade-for the sun was strong-along the many-coloured and many-odoured port and through the streets in which, to English eyes, everything that was the same was a mystery and everything that was different a joke. ", "Best of all was to continue the creep up the long Grand' Rue to the gate of the haute ville and, passing beneath it, mount to the quaint and crooked rampart, with its rows of trees, its quiet corners and friendly benches where brown old women in such white-frilled caps and such long gold earrings sat and knitted or snoozed, its little yellow-faced houses that looked like the homes of misers or of priests and its dark ch\u00e2teau where small soldiers lounged on the bridge that stretched across an empty moat and military washing hung from the windows of towers. ", "This was a part of the place that could lead Maisie to enquire if it didn't just meet one's idea of the middle ages; ", "and since it was rather a satisfaction than a shock to perceive, and not for the first time, the limits in Mrs. Wix's mind of the historic imagination, that only added one more to the variety of kinds of insight that she felt it her own present mission to show. ", "They sat together on the old grey bastion; ", "they looked down on the little new town which seemed to them quite as old, and across at the great dome and the high gilt Virgin of the church that, as they gathered, was famous and that pleased them by its unlikeness to any place in which they had worshipped. ", "They wandered in this temple afterwards and Mrs. Wix confessed that for herself she had probably made a fatal mistake early in life in not being a Catholic. ", "Her confession in its turn caused Maisie to wonder rather interestedly what degree of lateness it was that shut the door against an escape from such an error. ", "They went back to the rampart on the second morning-the spot on which they appeared to have come furthest in the journey that was to separate them from everything objectionable in the past: ", "it gave them afresh the impression that had most to do with their having worked round to a confidence that on Maisie's part was determined and that she could see to be on her companion's desperate. ", "She had had for many hours the sense of showing Mrs. Wix so much that she was comparatively slow to become conscious of being at the same time the subject of a like aim. ", "The business went the faster, however, from the moment she got her glimpse of it; ", "it then fell into its place in her general, her habitual view of the particular phenomenon that, had she felt the need of words for it, she might have called her personal relation to her knowledge. ", "This relation had never been so lively as during the time she waited with her old governess for Sir Claude's reappearance, and what made it so was exactly that Mrs. Wix struck her as having a new suspicion of it. ", "Mrs. Wix had never yet had a suspicion-this was certain-so calculated to throw her pupil, in spite of the closer union of such adventurous hours, upon the deep defensive. ", "Her pupil made out indeed as many marvels as she had made out on the rush to Folkestone; ", "and if in Sir Claude's company on that occasion Mrs. Wix was the constant implication, so in Mrs. Wix's, during these hours, Sir Claude was-and most of all through long pauses-the perpetual, the insurmountable theme. ", "It all took them back to the first flush of his marriage and to the place he held in the schoolroom at that crisis of love and pain; ", "only he had himself blown to a much bigger balloon the large consciousness he then filled out. ", "They went through it all again, and indeed while the interval dragged by the very weight of its charm they went, in spite of defences and suspicions, through everything. ", "Their intensified clutch of the future throbbed like a clock ticking seconds; ", "but this was a timepiece that inevitably, as well, at the best, rang occasionally a portentous hour. ", "Oh there were several of these, and two or three of the worst on the old city-wall where everything else so made for peace. ", "There was nothing in the world Maisie more wanted than to be as nice to Mrs. Wix as Sir Claude had desired; ", "but it was exactly because this fell in with her inveterate instinct of keeping the peace that the instinct itself was quickened. ", "From the moment it was quickened, however, it found other work, and that was how, to begin with, she produced the very complication she most sought to avert. ", "What she had essentially done, these days, had been to read the unspoken into the spoken; ", "so that thus, with accumulations, it had become more definite to her that the unspoken was, unspeakably, the completeness of the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale. ", "There were times when every minute that Sir Claude stayed away was like a nail in Mrs. Beale's coffin. ", "That brought back to Maisie-it was a roundabout way-the beauty and antiquity of her connexion with the flower of the Overmores as well as that lady's own grace and charm, her peculiar prettiness and cleverness and even her peculiar tribulations. ", "A hundred things hummed at the back of her head, but two of these were simple enough. ", "Mrs. Beale was by the way, after all, just her stepmother and her relative. ", "She was just-and partly for that very reason-Sir Claude's greatest intimate (\"lady-intimate\" was Maisie's term) so that what together they were on Mrs. Wix's prescription to give up and break short off with was for one of them his particular favourite and for the other her father's wife. ", "Strangely, indescribably her perception of reasons kept pace with her sense of trouble; ", "but there was something in her that, without a supreme effort not to be shabby, couldn't take the reasons for granted. ", "What it comes to perhaps for ourselves is that, disinherited and denuded as we have seen her, there still lingered in her life an echo of parental influence-she was still reminiscent of one of the sacred lessons of home. ", "It was the only one she retained, but luckily she retained it with force. ", "She enjoyed in a word an ineffaceable view of the fact that there were things papa called mamma and mamma called papa a low sneak for doing or for not doing. ", "Now this rich memory gave her a name that she dreaded to invite to the lips of Mrs. Beale: ", "she should personally wince so just to hear it. ", "The very sweetness of the foreign life she was steeped in added with each hour of Sir Claude's absence to the possibility of such pangs. ", "She watched beside Mrs. Wix the great golden Madonna, and one of the ear-ringed old women who had been sitting at the end of their bench got up and pottered away. \" ", "Adieu mesdames!\" said the old woman in a little cracked civil voice-a demonstration by which our friends were so affected that they bobbed up and almost curtseyed to her. ", "They subsided again, and it was shortly after, in a summer hum of French insects and a phase of almost somnolent reverie, that Maisie most had the vision of what it was to shut out from such a perspective so appealing a participant. ", "It had not yet appeared so vast as at that moment, this prospect of statues shining in the blue and of courtesy in romantic forms. ", "\"Why after all should we have to choose between you? ", "Why shouldn't we be four?\" ", "she finally demanded. ", "Mrs. Wix gave the jerk of a sleeper awakened or the start even of one who hears a bullet whiz at the flag of truce. ", "Her stupefaction at such a breach of the peace delayed for a moment her answer. ", "\" Four improprieties, do you mean? ", "Because two of us happen to be decent people! ", "Do I gather you to wish that I should stay on with you even if that woman is capable-? ", "\" Maisie took her up before she could further phrase Mrs. Beale's capability. ", "\" Stay on as my companion-yes. ", "Stay on as just what you were at mamma's. ", "Mrs. Beale would let you!\" ", "the child said. ", "Mrs. Wix had by this time fairly sprung to her arms. ", "\" And who, I'd like to know, would let Mrs. Beale? ", "Do you mean, little unfortunate, that you would?\" ", "\"Why not, if now she's free?\" ", "\"Free? ", "Are you imitating him? ", "Well, if Sir Claude's old enough to know better, upon my word I think it's right to treat you as if you also were. ", "You'll have to, at any rate-to know better-if that's the line you're proposing to take.\" ", "Mrs. Wix had never been so harsh; ", "but on the other hand Maisie could guess that she herself had never appeared so wanton. ", "What was underlying, however, rather overawed than angered her; ", "she felt she could still insist-not for contradiction, but for ultimate calm. ", "Her wantonness meanwhile continued to work upon her friend, who caught again, on the rebound, the sound of deepest provocation. \" ", "Free, free, free? ", "If she's as free as you are, my dear, she's free enough, to be sure!\" ", "\"As I am?\"-Maisie, after reflexion and despite whatever of portentous this seemed to convey, risked a critical echo. ", "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Wix, \"nobody, you know, is free to commit a crime.\" ", "\"A crime!\" ", "The word had come out in a way that made the child sound it again. ", "\"You'd commit as great a one as their own-and so should I-if we were to condone their immorality by our presence. ", "\" Maisie waited a little; ", "this seemed so fiercely conclusive. ", "\" Why is it immorality?\" ", "she nevertheless presently enquired. ", "Her companion now turned upon her with a reproach softer because it was somehow deeper. ", "\" You're too unspeakable! ", "Do you know what we're talking about?\" ", "In the interest of ultimate calm Maisie felt that she must be above all clear. \" ", "Certainly; ", "about their taking advantage of their freedom.\" ", "\"Well, to do what?\" ", "\"Why, to live with us.\" ", "Mrs. Wix's laugh, at this, was literally wild. \"' Us?' ", "Thank you!\" ", "\"Then to live with me. ", "The words made her friend jump. ", "\" You give me up? ", "You break with me for ever? ", "You turn me into the street?\" ", "Maisie, though gasping a little, bore up under the rain of challenges. ", "\" Those, it seems to me, are the things you do to me.\" ", "Mrs. Wix made little of her valour. ", "\" I can promise you that, whatever I do, I shall never let you out of my sight!

", "That hand had shown altogether, these twenty-four hours, a new capacity for closing, and one of the truths the child could least resist was that a certain greatness had now come to Mrs. Wix. ", "The case was indeed that the quality of her motive surpassed the sharpness of her angles; ", "both the combination and the singularity of which things, when in the afternoon they used the carriage, Maisie could borrow from the contemplative hush of their grandeur the freedom to feel to the utmost. ", "She still bore the mark of the tone in which her friend had thrown out that threat of never losing sight of her. ", "This friend had been converted in short from feebleness to force; ", "and it was the light of her new authority that showed from how far she had come.

", "The moment at which this process had begun to mature was that of Mrs. Wix's breaking out with a dignity attuned to their own apartments and with an advantage now measurably gained. ", "They had ordered coffee after luncheon, in the spirit of Sir Claude's provision, and it was served to them while they awaited their equipage in the white and gold saloon. ", "It was flanked moreover with a couple of liqueurs, and Maisie felt that Sir Claude could scarce have been taken more at his word had it been followed by anecdotes and cigarettes. ", "The influence of these luxuries was at any rate in the air. ", "It seemed to her while she tiptoed at the chimney-glass, pulling on her gloves and with a motion of her head shaking a feather into place, to have had something to do with Mrs. Wix's suddenly saying: ", "Haven't you really and truly any moral sense? ", "\" Maisie was aware that her answer, though it brought her down to her heels, was vague even to imbecility, and that this was the first time she had appeared to practise with Mrs. Wix an intellectual inaptitude to meet her-the infirmity to which she had owed so much success with papa and mamma. ", "The appearance did her injustice, for it was not less through her candour than through her playfellow's pressure that after this the idea of a moral sense mainly coloured their intercourse. ", "She began, the poor child, with scarcely knowing what it was; ", "but it proved something that, with scarce an outward sign save her surrender to the swing of the carriage, she could, before they came back from their drive, strike up a sort of acquaintance with. ", "The beauty of the day only deepened, and the splendour of the afternoon sea, and the haze of the far headlands, and the taste of the sweet air. ", "It was the coachman indeed who, smiling and cracking his whip, turning in his place, pointing to invisible objects and uttering unintelligible sounds-all, our tourists recognised, strict features of a social order principally devoted to language: ", "it was this polite person, I say, who made their excursion fall so much short that their return left them still a stretch of the long daylight and an hour that, at his obliging suggestion, they spent on foot by the shining sands. ", "Maisie had seen the plage the day before with Sir Claude, but that was a reason the more for showing on the spot to Mrs. Wix that it was, as she said, another of the places on her list and of the things of which she knew the French name. ", "The bathers, so late, were absent and the tide was low; ", "the sea-pools twinkled in the sunset and there were dry places as well, where they could sit again and admire and expatiate: ", "a circumstance that, while they listened to the lap of the waves, gave Mrs. Wix a fresh support for her challenge. ", "\" Have you absolutely none at all? ", "\" She had no need now, as to the question itself at least, to be specific; ", "that on the other hand was the eventual result of their quiet conjoined apprehension of the thing that-well, yes, since they must face it-Maisie absolutely and appallingly had so little of. ", "This marked more particularly the moment of the child's perceiving that her friend had risen to a level which might-till superseded at all events-pass almost for sublime. ", "Nothing more remarkable had taken place in the first heat of her own departure, no act of perception less to be overtraced by our rough method, than her vision, the rest of that Boulogne day, of the manner in which she figured. ", "I so despair of courting her noiseless mental footsteps here that I must crudely give you my word for its being from this time forward a picture literally present to her. ", "Mrs. Wix saw her as a little person knowing so extraordinarily much that, for the account to be taken of it, what she still didn't know would be ridiculous if it hadn't been embarrassing. ", "Mrs. Wix was in truth more than ever qualified to meet embarrassment; ", "I am not sure that Maisie had not even a dim discernment of the queer law of her own life that made her educate to that sort of proficiency those elders with whom she was concerned. ", "She promoted, as it were, their development; ", "nothing could have been more marked for instance than her success in promoting Mrs. Beale's. ", "She judged that if her whole history, for Mrs. Wix, had been the successive stages of her knowledge, so the very climax of the concatenation would, in the same view, be the stage at which the knowledge should overflow. ", "As she was condemned to know more and more, how could it logically stop before she should know Most? ", "It came to her in fact as they sat there on the sands that she was distinctly on the road to know Everything. ", "She had not had governesses for nothing: ", "what in the world had she ever done but learn and learn and learn? ", "She looked at the pink sky with a placid foreboding that she soon should have learnt All. ", "They lingered in the flushed air till at last it turned to grey and she seemed fairly to receive new information from every brush of the breeze. ", "By the time they moved homeward it was as if this inevitability had become for Mrs. Wix a long, tense cord, twitched by a nervous hand, on which the valued pearls of intelligence were to be neatly strung. ", "In the evening upstairs they had another strange sensation, as to which Maisie couldn't afterwards have told you whether it was bang in the middle or quite at the beginning that her companion sounded with fresh emphasis the note of the moral sense. ", "What mattered was merely that she did exclaim, and again, as at first appeared, most disconnectedly: ", "God help me, it does seem to peep out! ", "\" Oh the queer confusions that had wooed it at last to such peeping! ", "None so queer, however, as the words of woe, and it might verily be said of rage, in which the poor lady bewailed the tragic end of her own rich ignorance. ", "There was a point at which she seized the child and hugged her as close as in the old days of partings and returns; ", "at which she was visibly at a loss how to make up to such a victim for such contaminations: ", "appealing, as to what she had done and was doing, in bewilderment, in explanation, in supplication, for reassurance, for pardon and even outright for pity. ", "\"I don't know what I've said to you, my own: ", "I don't know what I'm saying or what the turn you've given my life has rendered me, heaven forgive me, capable of saying.

", "I've just done it for you, precious-not to lose you, which would have been worst of all: ", "so that I've had to pay with my own innocence, if you do laugh! for clinging to you and keeping you. ", "Don't let me pay for nothing; ", "don't let me have been thrust for nothing into such horrors and such shames. ", "I never knew anything about them and I never wanted to know! ", "Now I know too much, too much!\" ", "the poor woman lamented and groaned. ", "\" I know so much that with hearing such talk I ask myself where I am; ", "and ", "with uttering it too, which is worse, say to myself that I'm far, too far, from where I started! ", "I ask myself what I should have thought with my lost one if I had heard myself cross the line. ", "There are lines I've crossed with you where I should have fancied I had come to a pretty pass-\" She gasped at the mere supposition. ", "\" I've gone from one thing to another, and all for the real love of you; ", "and now what would any one say-I mean any one but them-if they were to hear the way I go on? ", "I've had to keep up with you, haven't I?-and therefore what could I do less than look to you to keep up with me? ", "But it's not them that are the worst-by which I mean to say it's not him: ", "it's your dreadfully base papa and the one person in the world whom he could have found, I do believe-and she's not the Countess, duck-wickeder than himself. ", "While they were about it at any rate, since they were ruining you, they might have done it so as to spare an honest woman. ", "Then I shouldn't have had to do whatever it is that's the worst: ", "throw up at you the badness you haven't taken in, or find my advantage in the vileness you have! ", "What I did lose patience at this morning was at how it was that without your seeming to condemn-for you didn't, you remember!-you yet did seem to know. ", "Thank God, in his mercy, at last, if you do!\" ", "The night, this time, was warm, and one of the windows stood open to the small balcony over the rail of which, on coming back from dinner, Maisie had hung a long time in the enjoyment of the chatter, the lights, the life of the quay made brilliant by the season and the hour. ", "Mrs. Wix's requirements had drawn her in from this pasture and Mrs. Wix's embrace had detained her even though midway in the outpouring her confusion and sympathy had permitted, or rather had positively helped, her to disengage herself. ", "But the casement was still wide, the spectacle, the pleasure were still there, and from her place in the room, which, with its polished floor and its panels of elegance, was lighted from without more than from within, the child could still take account of them. ", "She appeared to watch and listen; ", "after which she answered Mrs. Wix with a question. ", "\" If I do know-?\" ", "\"If you do condemn. ", "\" The correction was made with some austerity. ", "It had the effect of causing Maisie to heave a vague sigh of oppression and then after an instant and as if under cover of this ambiguity pass out again upon the balcony. ", "She hung again over the rail; ", "she felt the summer night; ", "she dropped down into the manners of France. ", "There was a caf\u00e9 below the hotel, before which, with little chairs and tables, people sat on a space enclosed by plants in tubs; ", "and the impression was enriched by the flash of the white aprons of waiters and the music of a man and a woman who, from beyond the precinct, sent up the strum of a guitar and the drawl of a song about \"amour. ", "\" Maisie knew what \"amour\" meant too, and wondered if Mrs. Wix did: ", "Mrs. Wix remained within, as still as a mouse and perhaps not reached by the performance. ", "After a while, but not till the musicians had ceased and begun to circulate with a little plate, her pupil came back to her. \" ", "Is it a crime?\" ", "Maisie then asked. ", "Mrs. Wix was as prompt as if she had been crouching in a lair. \" ", "Branded by the Bible.\" ", "\"Well, he won't commit a crime.\" ", "Mrs. Wix looked at her gloomily. \" ", "He's committing one now.\" ", "\"Now?\" ", "\"In being with her. ", "\" Maisie had it on her tongue's end to return once more: ", "But now he's free. ", "She remembered, however, in time that one of the things she had known for the last entire hour was that this made no difference. ", "After that, and as if to turn the right way, she was on the point of a blind dash, a weak reversion to the reminder that it might make a difference, might diminish the crime for Mrs. Beale; ", "till such a reflexion was in its order also quashed by the visibility in Mrs. Wix's face of the collapse produced by her inference from her pupil's manner that after all her pains her pupil didn't even yet adequately understand. ", "Never so much as when confronted had Maisie wanted to understand, and all her thought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something which should be a disproof of her simplicity. \" ", "Just trust me, dear; ", "that's all!\"-she came out finally with that; ", "and it was perhaps a good sign of her action that with a long, impartial moan Mrs. Wix floated her to bed. ", "There was no letter the next morning from Sir Claude-which Mrs. Wix let out that she deemed the worst of omens; ", "yet it was just for the quieter communion they so got with him that, when after the coffee and rolls which made them more foreign than ever, it came to going forth for fresh drafts upon his credit they wandered again up the hill to the rampart instead of plunging into distraction with the crowd on the sands or into the sea with the semi-nude bathers. ", "They gazed once more at their gilded Virgin; ", "they sank once more upon their battered bench; ", "they felt once more their distance from the Regent's Park. ", "At last Mrs. Wix became definite about their friend's silence. ", "\" He is afraid of her! ", "She has forbidden him to write. ", "\" The fact of his fear Maisie already knew; ", "but her companion's mention of it had at this moment two unexpected results. ", "The first was her wondering in dumb remonstrance how Mrs. Wix, with a devotion not after all inferior to her own, could put into such an allusion such a grimness of derision; ", "the second was that she found herself suddenly drop into a deeper view of it. ", "She too had been afraid, as we have seen, of the people of whom Sir Claude was afraid, and by that law she had had her due measure of latest apprehension of Mrs. Beale. ", "What occurred at present, however, was that, whereas this sympathy appeared vain as for him, the ground of it loomed dimly as a reason for selfish alarm. ", "That uneasiness had not carried her far before Mrs. Wix spoke again and with an abruptness so great as almost to seem irrelevant. \" ", "Has it never occurred to you to be jealous of her? ", "\" It never had in the least; ", "yet the words were scarce in the air before Maisie had jumped at them. ", "She held them well, she looked at them hard; ", "at last she brought out with an assurance which there was no one, alas, but herself to admire: ", "Well, yes-since you ask me. ", "She debated, then continued: ", "Lots of times!\" ", "Mrs. Wix glared askance an instant; ", "such approval as her look expressed was not wholly unqualified. ", "It expressed at any rate something that presumably had to do with her saying once more: ", "Yes. ", "He's afraid of her. ", "\" Maisie heard, and it had afresh its effect on her even through the blur of the attention now required by the possibility of that idea of jealousy-a possibility created only by her feeling she had thus found the way to show she was not simple. ", "It struck out of Mrs. Wix that this lady still believed her moral sense to be interested and feigned; ", "so what could be such a gage of her sincerity as a peep of the most restless of the passions? ", "Such a revelation would baffle discouragement, and discouragement was in fact so baffled that, helped in some degree by the mere intensity of their need to hope, which also, according to its nature, sprang from the dark portent of the absent letter, the real pitch of their morning was reached by the note, not of mutual scrutiny, but of unprecedented frankness. ", "There were broodings indeed and silences, and Maisie sank deeper into the vision that for her friend she was, at the most, superficial, and that also, positively, she was the more so the more she tried to appear complete. ", "Was the sum of all knowledge only to know how little in this presence one would ever reach it? ", "The answer to that question luckily lost itself in the brightness suffusing the scene as soon as Maisie had thrown out in regard to Mrs. Beale such a remark as she had never dreamed she should live to make. ", "\" If I thought she was unkind to him-I don't know what I should do!\" ", "Mrs. Wix dropped one of her squints; ", "she even confirmed it by a wild grunt. ", "\" I know what I should!\" ", "Maisie at this felt that she lagged. ", "Well, I can think of one thing.\" ", "Mrs. Wix more directly challenged her. ", "\" What is it then? ", "\" Maisie met her expression as if it were a game with forfeits for winking. ", "\" I'd kill her!\" ", "That at least, she hoped as she looked away, would guarantee her moral sense. ", "She looked away, but her companion said nothing for so long that she at last turned her head again. ", "Then she saw the straighteners all blurred with tears which after a little seemed to have sprung from her own eyes. ", "There were tears in fact on both sides of the spectacles, and they were even so thick that it was presently all Maisie could do to make out through them that slowly, finally Mrs. Wix put forth a hand. ", "It was the material pressure that settled this and even at the end of some minutes more things besides. ", "It settled in its own way one thing in particular, which, though often, between them, heaven knew, hovered round and hung over, was yet to be established without the shadow of an attenuating smile. ", "Oh there was no gleam of levity, as little of humour as of deprecation, in the long time they now sat together or in the way in which at some unmeasured point of it Mrs. Wix became distinct enough for her own dignity and yet not loud enough for the snoozing old women. ", "\"I adore him. ", "I adore him. ", "Maisie took it well in; ", "so well that in a moment more she would have answered profoundly: ", "So do I.\" ", "But before that moment passed something took place that brought other words to her lips; ", "nothing more, very possibly, than the closer consciousness in her hand of the significance of Mrs. Wix's. ", "Their hands remained linked in unutterable sign of their union, and what Maisie at last said was simply and serenely: ", "Oh I know! ", "\" Their hands were so linked and their union was so confirmed that it took the far deep note of a bell, borne to them on the summer air, to call them back to a sense of hours and proprieties. ", "They had touched bottom and melted together, but they gave a start at last: ", "the bell was the voice of the inn and the inn was the image of luncheon. ", "They should be late for it; ", "they got up, and their quickened step on the return had something of the swing of confidence. ", "When they reached the hotel the table d'h\u00f4te had begun; ", "this was clear from the threshold, clear from the absence in the hall and on the stairs of the \"personnel,\" as Mrs. Wix said-she had picked that up-all collected in the dining-room. ", "They mounted to their apartments for a brush before the glass, and it was Maisie who, in passing and from a vain impulse, threw open the white and gold door. ", "She was thus first to utter the sound that brought Mrs. Wix almost on top of her, as by the other accident it would have brought her on top of Mrs. Wix. ", "It had at any rate the effect of leaving them bunched together in a strained stare at their new situation. ", "This situation had put on in a flash the bright form of Mrs. Beale: ", "she stood there in her hat and her jacket, amid bags and shawls, smiling and holding out her arms. ", "If she had just arrived it was a different figure from either of the two that for their benefit, wan and tottering and none too soon to save life, the Channel had recently disgorged. ", "She was as lovely as the day that had brought her over, as fresh as the luck and the health that attended her: ", "it came to Maisie on the spot that she was more beautiful than she had ever been. ", "All this was too quick to count, but there was still time in it to give the child the sense of what had kindled the light. ", "That leaped out of the open arms, the open eyes, the open mouth; ", "it leaped out with Mrs. Beale's loud cry at her: ", "I'm free, I'm free!\" ", "XXVII    ", "The greatest wonder of all was the way Mrs. Beale addressed her announcement, so far as could be judged, equally to Mrs. Wix, who, as if from sudden failure of strength, sank into a chair while Maisie surrendered to the visitor's embrace. ", "As soon as the child was liberated she met with profundity Mrs. Wix's stupefaction and actually was able to see that while in a manner sustaining the encounter her face yet seemed with intensity to say: ", "\"Now, for God's sake, don't crow 'I told you so!' ", "\" Maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition to crow; ", "it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick survey of the objects surrounding Mrs. Beale as showed that among them was no appurtenance of Sir Claude's. ", "She knew his dressing-bag now-oh with the fondest knowledge!-and there was an instant during which its not being there was a stroke of the worst news. ", "She was yet to learn what it could be to recognise in some lapse of a sequence the proof of an extinction, and therefore remained unaware that this momentary pang was a foretaste of the experience of death. ", "It of course yielded in a flash to Mrs. Beale's brightness, it gasped itself away in her own instant appeal. ", "\" You've come alone?\" ", "\"Without Sir Claude? ", "Strangely, Mrs. Beale looked even brighter. ", "Yes; ", "in the eagerness to get at you. ", "You abominable little ", "villain!\"-and her stepmother, laughing clear, administered to her cheek a pat that was partly a pinch. ", "\" What were you up to and what did you take me for? ", "But I'm glad to be abroad, and after all it's you who have shown me the way. ", "I mightn't, without you, have been able to come-to come, that is, so soon. ", "Well, here I am at any rate and in a moment more I should have begun to worry about you. ", "This will do very well\"-she was good-natured about the place and even presently added that it was charming. ", "Then with a rosier glow she made again her great point: ", "I'm free, I'm free!\" ", "Maisie made on her side her own: ", "she carried back her gaze to Mrs. Wix, whom amazement continued to hold; ", "she drew afresh her old friend's attention to the superior way she didn't take that up. ", "What she did take up the next minute was the question of Sir Claude. ", "\" Where is he? ", "Won't he come?\" ", "Mrs. Beale's consideration of this oscillated with a smile between the two expectancies with which she was flanked: ", "it was conspicuous, it was extraordinary, her unblinking acceptance of Mrs. Wix, a miracle of which Maisie had even now begun to read a reflexion in that lady's long visage. \" ", "He'll come, but we must make him!\" ", "she gaily brought forth. \" ", "Make him?\" ", "Maisie echoed. ", "\"We must give him time. ", "We must play our cards.\" ", "\"But he promised us awfully,\" Maisie replied. ", "\"My dear child, he has promised me awfully; ", "I mean lots of things, and not in every case kept his promise to the letter.\" ", "Mrs. Beale's good humour insisted on taking for granted Mrs. Wix's, to whom her attention had suddenly grown prodigious. ", "\" I dare say he has done the same with you, and not always come to time. ", "But he makes it up in his own way-and it isn't as if we didn't know exactly what he is. ", "There's one thing he is,\" she went on, \"which makes everything else only a question, for us, of tact. ", "\" They scarce had time to wonder what this was before, as they might have said, it flew straight into their face. ", "\" He's as free as I am!\" ", "\"Yes, I know,\" said Maisie; ", "as if, however, independently weighing the value of that. ", "She really weighed also the oddity of her stepmother's treating it as news to her, who had been the first person literally to whom Sir Claude had mentioned it. ", "For a few seconds, as if with the sound of it in her ears, she stood with him again, in memory and in the twilight, in the hotel garden at Folkestone. ", "Anything Mrs. Beale overlooked was, she indeed divined, but the effect of an exaltation of high spirits, a tendency to soar that showed even when she dropped-still quite impartially-almost to the confidential. \" ", "Well, then-we've only to wait.

", "The extent I count on you, you know, count on you to help me-\" was an extent that even all her radiance couldn't express. ", "What it couldn't express quite as much as what it could made at any rate every instant her presence and even her famous freedom loom larger; ", "and it was this mighty mass that once more led her companions, bewildered and disjoined, to exchange with each other as through a thickening veil confused and ineffectual signs. ", "They clung together at least on the common ground of unpreparedness, and Maisie watched without relief the havoc of wonder in Mrs. Wix. ", "It had reduced her to perfect impotence, and, but that gloom was black upon her, she sat as if fascinated by Mrs. Beale's high style. ", "It had plunged her into a long deep hush; ", "for what had happened was the thing she had least allowed for and before which the particular rigour she had worked up could only grow limp and sick.

", "\" I wear mine.\" ", "Mrs. Beale, swallowing at one glance her brand-new bravery, which she appeared at once to refer to its origin and to follow in its flights, accepted this as conclusive.

", "Mrs. Wix was more breathless than ever; ", "the embarrassment of Mrs. Beale's isolation was as nothing to the embarrassment of her grace. ", "The perception of this dilemma was the germ on the child's part of a new question altogether. ", "What if with this indulgence-? ", "But the idea lost itself in something too frightened for hope and too conjectured for fear; ", "and while everything went by leaps and bounds one of the waiters stood at the door to remind them that the table d'h\u00f4te was half over. \" ", "Had you come up to wash hands?\" ", "Mrs. Beale hereupon asked them. \" ", "Go and do it quickly and I'll be with you: ", "they've put my boxes in that nice room-it was Sir Claude's. ", "Trust him,\" she laughed, \"to have a nice one!\" ", "The door of a neighbouring room stood open, and now from the threshold, addressing herself again to Mrs. Wix, she launched a note that gave the very key of what, as she would have said, she was up to. ", "\" Dear lady, please attend to my daughter. ", "\" She was up to a change of deportment so complete that it represented-oh for offices still honourably subordinate if not too explicitly menial-an absolute coercion, an interested clutch of the old woman's respectability. ", "There was response, to Maisie's view, I may say at once, in the jump of that respectability to its feet: ", "it was itself capable of one of the leaps, one of the bounds just mentioned, and it carried its charge, with this momentum and while Mrs. Beale popped into Sir Claude's chamber, straight away to where, at the end of the passage, pupil and governess were quartered. ", "The greatest stride of all, for that matter, was that within a few seconds the pupil had, in another relation, been converted into a daughter. ", "Maisie's eyes were still following it when, after the rush, with the door almost slammed and no thought of soap and towels, the pair stood face to face. ", "Mrs. Wix, in this position, was the first to gasp a sound. \" ", "Can it ever be that she has one? ", "Maisie felt still more bewildered. ", "One what?\" ", "\"Why moral sense. ", "\" They spoke as if you might have two, but Mrs. Wix looked as if it were not altogether a happy thought, and Maisie didn't see how even an affirmative from her own lips would clear up what had become most of a mystery.

", "\" It was a point as to which an horrific glimpse of the responsibility of an opinion appeared to affect Mrs. Wix like a blow in the stomach.

", "Some of their money to his wife?\" ", "Mrs. Wix pave a laugh still stranger than the weird suggestion. ", "\" I dare say she'd take it!\" ", "They hurried on again; ", "yet again, on the stairs, Maisie pulled up. \" ", "Well, if she had stopped in England-! ", "\" she threw out. ", "Mrs. Wix considered. \" ", "And he had come over instead?\" ", "\"Yes, as we expected. ", "\" Maisie launched her speculation. ", "\" What then would she have lived on?\" ", "Mrs. Wix hung fire but an instant. ", "On other men!\" ", "And she marched downstairs. ", "XXVIII    ", "Mrs. Beale, at table between the pair, plainly attracted the attention Mrs. Wix had foretold. ", "No other lady present was nearly so handsome, nor did the beauty of any other accommodate itself with such art to the homage it produced. ", "She talked mainly to her other neighbour, and that left Maisie leisure both to note the manner in which eyes were riveted and nudges interchanged, and to lose herself in the meanings that, dimly as yet and disconnectedly, but with a vividness that fed apprehension, she could begin to read into her stepmother's independent move. ", "Mrs. Wix had helped her by talking of a game; ", "it was a connexion in which the move could put on a strategic air. ", "Her notions of diplomacy were thin, but it was a kind of cold diplomatic shoulder and an elbow of more than usual point that, temporarily at least, were presented to her by the averted inclination of Mrs. Beale's head. ", "There was a phrase familiar to Maisie, so often was it used by this lady to express the idea of one's getting what one wanted: ", "one got it-Mrs. Beale always said she at all events always got it or proposed to get it-by \"making love. ", "She was at present making love, singular as it appeared, to Mrs. Wix, and her young friend's mind had never moved in such freedom as on thus finding itself face to face with the question of what she wanted to get. ", "This period of the omelette aux rognons and the poulet saut\u00e9, while her sole surviving parent, her fourth, fairly chattered to her governess, left Maisie rather wondering if her governess would hold out. ", "It was strange, but she became on the spot quite as interested in Mrs. Wix's moral sense as Mrs. Wix could possibly be in hers: ", "it had risen before her so pressingly that this was something new for Mrs. Wix to resist. ", "Resisting Mrs. Beale herself promised at such a rate to become a very different business from resisting Sir Claude's view of her. ", "More might come of what had happened-whatever it was-than Maisie felt she could have expected. ", "She put it together with a suspicion that, had she ever in her life had a sovereign changed, would have resembled an impression, baffled by the want of arithmetic, that her change was wrong: ", "she groped about in it that she was perhaps playing the passive part in a case of violent substitution. ", "A victim was what she should surely be if the issue between her step-parents had been settled by Mrs. Beale's saying: ", "Well, if she can live with but one of us alone, with which in the world should it be but me? ", "\" That answer was far from what, for days, she had nursed herself in, and the desolation of it was deepened by the absence of anything from Sir Claude to show he had not had to take it as triumphant. ", "Had not Mrs. Beale, upstairs, as good as given out that she had quitted him with the snap of a tension, left him, dropped him in London, after some struggle as a sequel to which her own advent represented that she had practically sacrificed him? ", "Maisie assisted in fancy at the probable episode in the Regent's Park, finding elements almost of terror in the suggestion that Sir Claude had not had fair play. ", "They drew something, as she sat there, even from the pride of an association with such beauty as Mrs. Beale's; ", "and the child quite forgot that, though the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale herself was a solution she had not invented, she would probably have seen Sir Claude embark upon it without a direct remonstrance. ", "What her stepmother had clearly now promised herself to wring from Mrs. Wix was an assent to the great modification, the change, as smart as a juggler's trick, in the interest of which nothing so much mattered as the new convenience of Mrs. Beale. ", "Maisie could positively seize the moral that her elbow seemed to point in ribs thinly defended-the moral of its not mattering a straw which of the step-parents was the guardian. ", "The essence of the question was that a girl wasn't a boy: ", "if Maisie had been a mere rough trousered thing, destined at the best probably to grow up a scamp, Sir Claude would have been welcome. ", "As the case stood he had simply tumbled out of it, and Mrs. Wix would henceforth find herself in the employ of the right person. ", "These arguments had really fallen into their place, for our young friend, at the very touch of that tone in which she had heard her new title declared. ", "She was still, as a result of so many parents, a daughter to somebody even after papa and mamma were to all intents dead. ", "If her father's wife and her mother's husband, by the operation of a natural or, for all she knew, a legal rule, were in the shoes of their defunct partners, then Mrs. Beale's partner was exactly as defunct as Sir Claude's and her shoes the very pair to which, in \"Farange v. Farange and Others,\" the divorce court had given priority. ", "The subject of that celebrated settlement saw the rest of her day really filled out with the pomp of all that Mrs. Beale assumed. ", "The assumption rounded itself there between this lady's entertainers, flourished in a way that left them, in their bottomless element, scarce a free pair of eyes to exchange signals. ", "It struck Maisie even a little that there was a rope or two Mrs. Wix might have thrown out if she would, a rocket or two she might have sent up. ", "They had at any rate never been so long together without communion or telegraphy, and their companion kept them apart by simply keeping them with her. ", "From this situation they saw the grandeur of their intenser relation to her pass and pass like an endless procession. ", "It was a day of lively movement and of talk on Mrs. Beale's part so brilliant and overflowing as to represent music and banners. ", "She took them out with her promptly to walk and to drive, and even-towards night-sketched a plan for carrying them to the Etablissement, where, for only a franc apiece, they should listen to a concert of celebrities. ", "It reminded Maisie, the plan, of the side-shows at Earl's Court, and the franc sounded brighter than the shillings which had at that time failed; ", "yet this too, like the other, was a frustrated hope: ", "the francs failed like the shillings and the side-shows had set an example to the concert. ", "The Etablissement in short melted away, and it was little wonder that a lady who from the moment of her arrival had been so gallantly in the breach should confess herself it last done up. ", "Maisie could appreciate her fatigue; ", "the day had not passed without such an observer's discovering that she was excited and even mentally comparing her state to that of the breakers after a gale. ", "It had blown hard in London, and she would take time to go down. ", "It was of the condition known to the child by report as that of talking against time that her emphasis, her spirit, her humour, which had never dropped, now gave the impression. ", "She too was delighted with foreign manners; ", "but her daughter's opportunities of explaining them to her were unexpectedly forestalled by her own tone of large acquaintance with them. ", "One of the things that nipped in the bud all response to her volubility was Maisie's surprised retreat before the fact that Continental life was what she had been almost brought up on. ", "It was Mrs. Beale, disconcertingly, who began to explain it to her friends; ", "it was she who, wherever they turned, was the interpreter, the historian and the guide. ", "She was full of reference to her early travels-at the age of eighteen: ", "she had at that period made, with a distinguished Dutch family, a stay on the Lake of Geneva. ", "Maisie had in the old days been regaled with anecdotes of these adventures, but they had with time become phantasmal, and the heroine's quite showy exemption from bewilderment at Boulogne, her acuteness on some of the very subjects on which Maisie had been acute to Mrs. Wix, were a high note of the majesty, of the variety of advantage, with which she had alighted. ", "It was all a part of the wind in her sails and of the weight with which her daughter was now to feel her hand. ", "The effect of it on Maisie was to add already the burden of time to her separation from Sir Claude. ", "This might, to her sense, have lasted for days; ", "it was as if, with their main agitation transferred thus to France and with neither mamma now nor Mrs. Beale nor Mrs. Wix nor herself at his side, he must be fearfully alone in England. ", "Hour after hour she felt as if she were waiting; ", "yet she couldn't have said exactly for what. ", "There were moments when Mrs. Beale's flow of talk was a mere rattle to smother a knock. ", "At no part of the crisis had the rattle so public a purpose as when, instead of letting Maisie go with Mrs. Wix to prepare for dinner, she pushed her-with a push at last incontestably maternal-straight into the room inherited from Sir Claude. ", "She titivated her little charge with her own brisk hands; ", "then she brought out: ", "I'm going to divorce your father. ", "\" This was so different from anything Maisie had expected that it took some time to reach her mind. ", "She was aware meanwhile that she probably looked rather wan. \" ", "To marry Sir Claude?\" ", "Mrs. Beale rewarded her with a kiss. ", "\" It's sweet to hear you put it so. ", "\" This was a tribute, but it left Maisie balancing for an objection. ", "\" How can you when he's married?\" ", "\"He isn't-practically. ", "He's free, you know.\" ", "\"Free to marry?\" ", "\"Free, first, to divorce his own fiend. ", "The benefit that, these last days, she had felt she owed a certain person left Maisie a moment so ill-prepared for recognising this lurid label that she hesitated long enough to risk: ", "\"Mamma?\" ", "\"She isn't your mamma any longer,\" Mrs. Beale returned. \" ", "Sir Claude has paid her money to cease to be.\" ", "Then as if remembering how little, to the child, a pecuniary transaction must represent: ", "She lets him off supporting her if he'll let her off supporting you.\" ", "Mrs. Beale appeared, however, to have done injustice to her daughter's financial grasp. \" ", "And support me himself?\" ", "Maisie asked. ", "\"Take the whole bother and burden of you and never let her hear of you again. ", "It's a regular signed contract.\" ", "\"Why that's lovely of her!\" ", "Maisie cried. ", "\"It's not so lovely, my dear, but that he'll get his divorce.\" ", "Maisie was briefly silent; ", "after which, \"No-he won't get it,\" she said. ", "Then she added still more boldly: ", "And you won't get yours.\" ", "Mrs. Beale, who was at the dressing-glass, turned round with amusement and surprise. ", "\" How do you know that?\" ", "\"Oh I know!\" cried Maisie. ", "From Mrs. Wix? ", "Maisie debated, then after an instant took her cue from Mrs. Beale's absence of anger, which struck her the more as she had felt how much of her courage she needed. ", "\" From Mrs. Wix,\" she admitted. ", "Mrs. Beale, at the glass again, made play with a powder-puff. ", "\" My own sweet, she's mistaken!\" was all she said. ", "There was a certain force in the very amenity of this, but our young lady reflected long enough to remember that it was not the answer Sir Claude himself had made. ", "The recollection nevertheless failed to prevent her saying: ", "Do you mean then that he won't come till he has got it?\" ", "Mrs. Beale gave a last touch; ", "she was ready; ", "she stood there in all her elegance. ", "\" I mean, my dear, that it's because he hasn't got it that I left him.\" ", "This opened a view that stretched further than Maisie could reach. ", "She turned away from it, but she spoke before they went out again. \" ", "Do you like Mrs. Wix now?\" ", "\"Why, my chick, I was just going to ask you if you think she has come at all to like poor bad me!\" ", "Maisie thought, at this hint; ", "but unsuccessfully. ", "\" I haven't the least idea. ", "But I'll find out.\" ", "\"Do!\" said Mrs. Beale, rustling out with her in a scented air and as if it would be a very particular favour. ", "The child tried promptly at bed-time, relieved now of the fear that their visitor would wish to separate her for the night from her attendant. ", "\" Have you held out? ", "she began as soon as the two doors at the end of the passage were again closed on them. ", "Mrs. Wix looked hard at the flame of the candle. \" ", "Held out-?\" ", "\"Why, she has been making love to you. ", "Has she won you over?\" ", "Mrs. Wix transferred her intensity to her pupil's face. ", "Over to what?\" ", "\"To her keeping me instead.\" ", "\"Instead of Sir Claude? ", "Mrs. Wix was distinctly gaining time. ", "Yes; ", "who else? since it's not instead of you.\" ", "Mrs. Wix coloured at this lucidity. ", "\" Yes, that is what she means.\" ", "\"Well, do you like it?\" ", "Maisie asked. ", "She actually had to wait, for oh her friend was embarrassed! \" ", "My opposition to the connexion-theirs-would then naturally to some extent fall. ", "She has treated me to-day as if I weren't after all quite such a worm; ", "not that I don't know very well where she got the pattern of her politeness. ", "But of course,\" Mrs. Wix hastened to add, \"I shouldn't like her as the one nearly so well as him.\" ", "\"'Nearly so well!' ", "\" Maisie echoed. ", "\" I should hope indeed not.\" ", "She spoke with a firmness under which she was herself the first to quiver. ", "\" I thought you 'adored' him.\" ", "\"I do,\" Mrs. Wix sturdily allowed. \" ", "Then have you suddenly begun to adore her too?\" ", "Mrs. Wix, instead of directly answering, only blinked in support of her sturdiness. ", "\" My dear, in what a tone you ask that! ", "You're coming out.\" ", "\"Why shouldn't I? ", "You've come out. ", "Mrs. Beale has come out. ", "We each have our turn!\" ", "And Maisie threw off the most extraordinary little laugh that had ever passed her young lips. ", "There passed Mrs. Wix's indeed the next moment a sound that more than matched it. ", "\" You're most remarkable!\" ", "she neighed. ", "Her pupil, though wholly without aspirations to pertness, barely faltered. ", "\" I think you've done a great deal to make me so.\" ", "\"Very true, I have. ", "\" She dropped to humility, as if she recalled her so recent self-arraignment. \" ", "Would you accept her then? ", "That's what I ask,\" said Maisie. ", "As a substitute? ", "\" Mrs. Wix turned it over; ", "she met again the child's eyes. ", "\" She has literally almost fawned upon me.\" ", "\"She hasn't fawned upon him.

", "Maisie looked at her a moment, then began to undress. ", "\" Oh you're nobody!\" ", "XXIX   Her sleep was drawn out, she instantly recognised lateness in the way her eyes opened to Mrs. Wix, erect, completely dressed, more dressed than ever, and gazing at her from the centre of the room. ", "The next thing she was sitting straight up, wide awake with the fear of the hours of \"abroad\" that she might have lost. ", "Mrs. Wix looked as if the day had already made itself felt, and the process of catching up with it began for Maisie in hearing her distinctly say: ", "My poor dear, he has come!\" ", "\"Sir Claude?

", "To that degree it was successful; ", "there was only an appeal, strange and mute, in the white old face, which produced the effect of a want of decision greater than could by any stretch of optimism have been associated with her attitude toward what had happened. ", "For Maisie herself indeed what had happened was oddly, as she could feel, less of a simple rapture than any arrival or return of the same supreme friend had ever been before. ", "What had become overnight, what had become while she slept, of the comfortable faculty of gladness? ", "She tried to wake it up a little wider by talking, by rejoicing, by plunging into water and into clothes, and she made out that it was ten o'clock, but also that Mrs. Wix had not yet breakfasted. ", "The day before, at nine, they had had together a caf\u00e9 complet in their sitting-room. ", "Mrs. Wix on her side had evidently also a refuge to seek. ", "She sought it in checking the precipitation of some of her pupil's present steps, in recalling to her with an approach to sternness that of such preliminaries those embodied in a thorough use of soap should be the most thorough, and in throwing even a certain reprobation on the idea of hurrying into clothes for the sake of a mere stepfather. ", "She took her in hand with a silent insistence; ", "she reduced the process to sequences more definite than any it had known since the days of Moddle. ", "Whatever it might be that had now, with a difference, begun to belong to Sir Claude's presence was still after all compatible, for our young lady, with the instinct of dressing to see him with almost untidy haste.

", "Madame!\" ", "He had already, at the foot of the stair, called out to the stout patronne, a lady who turned to him from the bustling, breezy hall a countenance covered with fresh matutinal powder and a bosom as capacious as the velvet shelf of a chimneypiece, over which her round white face, framed in its golden frizzle, might have figured as a showy clock. ", "He ordered, with particular recommendations, Mrs. Wix's repast, and it was a charm to hear his easy brilliant French: ", "even his companion's ignorance could measure the perfection of it. ", "The patronne, rubbing her hands and breaking in with high swift notes as into a florid duet, went with him to the street, and while they talked a moment longer Maisie remembered what Mrs. Wix had said about every one's liking him. ", "It came out enough through the morning powder, it came out enough in the heaving bosom, how the landlady liked him. ", "He had evidently ordered something lovely for Mrs. Wix. ", "\" Et bien soign\u00e9, n'est-ce-pas?\" ", "\"Soyez tranquille\"-the patronne beamed upon him. \" ", "Et pour Madame?\" ", "\"Madame?\" ", "he echoed-it just pulled him up a little. \" ", "Rien encore?\" ", "\"Rien encore. ", "Come, Maisie.\" ", "She hurried along with him, but on the way to the caf\u00e9 he said nothing. ", "XXX   After they were seated there it was different: ", "the place was not below the hotel, but further along the quay; ", "with wide, clear windows and a floor sprinkled with bran in a manner that gave it for Maisie something of the added charm of a circus. ", "They had pretty much to themselves the painted spaces and the red plush benches; ", "these were shared by a few scattered gentlemen who picked teeth, with facial contortions, behind little bare tables, and by an old personage in particular, a very old personage with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, whose manner of soaking buttered rolls in coffee and then disposing of them in the little that was left of the interval between his nose and chin might at a less anxious hour have cast upon Maisie an almost envious spell. ", "They too had their caf\u00e9 au lait and their buttered rolls, determined by Sir Claude's asking her if she could with that light aid wait till the hour of d\u00e9jeuner. ", "His allusion to this meal gave her, in the shaded sprinkled coolness, the scene, as she vaguely felt, of a sort of ordered mirrored licence, the haunt of those-the irregular, like herself-who went to bed or who rose too late, something to think over while she watched the white-aproned waiter perform as nimbly with plates and saucers as a certain conjurer her friend had in London taken her to a music-hall to see. ", "Sir Claude had presently begun to talk again, to tell her how London had looked and how long he had felt himself, on either side, to have been absent; ", "all about Susan Ash too and the amusement as well as the difficulty he had had with her; ", "then all about his return journey and the Channel in the night and the crowd of people coming over and the way there were always too many one knew. ", "He spoke of other matters beside, especially of what she must tell him of the occupations, while he was away, of Mrs. Wix and her pupil. ", "Hadn't they had the good time he had promised?-had ", "he exaggerated a bit the arrangements made for their pleasure? ", "Maisie had something-not all there was-to say of his success and of their gratitude: ", "she had a complication of thought that grew every minute, grew with the consciousness that she had never seen him in this particular state in which he had been given back. ", "Mrs. Wix had once said-it was once or fifty times; ", "once was enough for Maisie, but more was not too much-that he was wonderfully various. ", "Well, he was certainly so, to the child's mind, on the present occasion: ", "he was much more various than he was anything else. ", "Besides, the fact that they were together in a shop, at a nice little intimate table as they had so often been in London, only made greater the difference of what they were together about. ", "This difference was in his face, in his voice, in every look he gave her and every movement he made. ", "They were not the looks and the movements he really wanted to show, and she could feel as well that they were not those she herself wanted. ", "She had seen him nervous, she had seen every one she had come in contact with nervous, but she had never seen him so nervous as this. ", "Little by little it gave her a settled terror, a terror that partook of the coldness she had felt just before, at the hotel, to find herself, on his answer about Mrs. Beale, disbelieve him. ", "She seemed to see at present, to touch across the table, as if by laying her hand on it, what he had meant when he confessed on those several occasions to fear. ", "Why was such a man so often afraid? ", "It must have begun to come to her now that there was one thing just such a man above all could be afraid of. ", "He could be afraid of himself. ", "His fear at all events was there; ", "his fear was sweet to her, beautiful and tender to her, was having coffee and buttered rolls and talk and laughter that were no talk and laughter at all with her; ", "his fear was in his jesting postponing perverting voice; ", "it was just in this make-believe way he had brought her out to imitate the old London playtimes, to imitate indeed a relation that had wholly changed, a relation that she had with her very eyes seen in the act of change when, the day before in the salon, Mrs. Beale rose suddenly before her. ", "She rose before her, for that matter, now, and even while their refreshment delayed Maisie arrived at the straight question for which, on their entrance, his first word had given opportunity. \" ", "Are we going to have d\u00e9jeuner with Mrs. Beale?\" ", "His reply was anything but straight. ", "You and I? ", "\" Maisie sat back in her chair. \" ", "Mrs. Wix and me.\" ", "Sir Claude also shifted. ", "\" That's an enquiry, my dear child, that Mrs. Beale herself must answer. ", "\" Yes, he had shifted; ", "but abruptly, after a moment during which something seemed to hang there between them and, as it heavily swayed, just fan them with the air of its motion, she felt that the whole thing was upon them. \" ", "Do you mind,\" he broke out, \"my asking you what Mrs. Wix has said to you?\" ", "\"Said to me?\" ", "\"This day or two-while I was away.\" ", "\"Do you mean about you and Mrs. Beale?\" ", "Sir Claude, resting on his elbows, fixed his eyes a moment on the white marble beneath them. ", "No; ", "I think we had a good deal of that-didn't we?-before I left you. ", "It seems to me we had it pretty well all out. ", "I mean about yourself, about your-don't you know?-associating with us, as I might say, and staying on with us. ", "While you were alone with our friend what did she say? ", "\" Maisie felt the weight of the question; ", "it kept her silent for a space during which she looked at Sir Claude, whose eyes remained bent. ", "\" Nothing,\" she returned at last. ", "He showed incredulity. ", "\" Nothing?\" ", "\"Nothing,\" Maisie repeated; ", "on which an interruption descended in the form of a tray bearing the preparations for their breakfast. ", "These preparations were as amusing as everything else; ", "the waiter poured their coffee from a vessel like a watering-pot and then made it froth with the curved stream of hot milk that dropped from the height of his raised arm; ", "but the two looked across at each other through the whole play of French pleasantness with a gravity that had now ceased to dissemble. ", "Sir Claude sent the waiter off again for something and then took up her answer. \" ", "Hasn't she tried to affect you?\" ", "Face to face with him thus it seemed to Maisie that she had tried so little as to be scarce worth mentioning; ", "again therefore an instant she shut herself up. ", "Presently she found her middle course. \" ", "Mrs. Beale likes her now; ", "and there's one thing I've found out-a great thing. ", "Mrs. Wix enjoys her being so kind. ", "She was tremendously kind all day yesterday.\" ", "\"I see. ", "And what did she do?\" ", "Sir Claude asked. ", "Maisie was now busy with her breakfast, and her companion attacked his own; ", "so that it was all, in form at least, even more than their old sociability. ", "Everything she could think of. ", "She was as nice to her as you are,\" the child said. ", "\" She talked to her all day.\" ", "\"And what did she say to her?\" ", "\"Oh I don't know. ", "\" Maisie was a little bewildered with his pressing her so for knowledge; ", "it didn't fit into the degree of intimacy with Mrs. Beale that Mrs. Wix had so denounced and that, according to that lady, had now brought him back in bondage. ", "Wasn't he more aware than his stepdaughter of what would be done by the person to whom he was bound? ", "In a moment, however, she added: ", "She made love to her.\" ", "Sir Claude looked at her harder, and it was clearly something in her tone that made him quickly say: ", "\"You don't mind my asking you, do you?\" ", "\"Not at all; ", "only I should think you'd know better than I.\"  \"What Mrs. Beale did yesterday?\" ", "She thought he coloured a trifle; ", "but almost simultaneously with that impression she found herself answering: ", "Yes-if you have seen her.\" ", "He broke into the loudest of laughs. ", "\" Why, my dear boy, I told you just now I've absolutely not. ", "I say, don't you believe me? ", "\" There was something she was already so afraid of that it covered up other fears. \" ", "Didn't you come back to see her?\" ", "she enquired in a moment. \" ", "Didn't you come back because you always want to so much?\" ", "He received her enquiry as he had received her doubt-with an extraordinary absence of resentment. ", "\" I can imagine of course why you think that. ", "But it doesn't explain my doing what I have. ", "It was, as I said to you just now at the inn, really and truly you I wanted to see. ", "\" She felt an instant as she used to feel when, in the back garden at her mother's, she took from him the highest push of a swing-high, high, high-that he had had put there for her pleasure and that had finally broken down under the weight and the extravagant patronage of the cook. \" ", "Well, that's beautiful. ", "But to see me, you mean, and go away again?\" ", "\"My going away again is just the point. ", "I can't tell yet-it all depends.\" ", "\"On Mrs. Beale? ", "\" Maisie asked. ", "\" She won't go away.\" ", "He finished emptying his coffee-cup and then, when he had put it down, leaned back in his chair, where she could see that he smiled on her. ", "This only added to her idea that he was in trouble, that he was turning somehow in his pain and trying different things. ", "He continued to smile and she went on: ", "\"Don't you know that?\" ", "\"Yes, I may as well confess to you that as much as that I do know. ", "She won't go away.

", "If they were afraid of themselves it was themselves they would find at the inn. ", "She was certain now that what awaited them there would be to lunch with Mrs. Beale. ", "All her instinct was to avoid that, to draw out their walk, to find pretexts, to take him down upon the beach, to take him to the end of the pier. ", "He said no other word to her about what they had talked of at breakfast, and she had a dim vision of how his way of not letting her see him definitely wait for anything from her would make any one who should know of it, would make Mrs. Wix for instance, think him more than ever a gentleman. ", "It was true that once or twice, on the jetty, on the sands, he looked at her for a minute with eyes that seemed to propose to her to come straight off with him to Paris. ", "That, however, was not to give her a nudge about her responsibility. ", "He evidently wanted to procrastinate quite as much as she did; ", "he was not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the others. ", "Maisie herself at this moment could be secretly merciless to Mrs. Wix-to the extent at any rate of not caring if her continued disappearance did make that lady begin to worry about what had become of her, even begin to wonder perhaps if the truants hadn't found their remedy. ", "Her want of mercy to Mrs. Beale indeed was at least as great; ", "for Mrs. Beale's worry and wonder would be as much greater as the object at which they were directed. ", "When at last Sir Claude, at the far end of the plage, which they had already, in the many-coloured crowd, once traversed, suddenly, with a look at his watch, remarked that it was time, not to get back to the table d'h\u00f4te, but to get over to the station and meet the Paris papers-when he did this she found herself thinking quite with intensity what Mrs. Beale and Mrs. Wix would say. ", "On the way over to the station she had even a mental picture of the stepfather and the pupil established in a little place in the South while the governess and the stepmother, in a little place in the North, remained linked by a community of blankness and by the endless series of remarks it would give birth to. ", "The Paris papers had come in and her companion, with a strange extravagance, purchased no fewer than eleven: ", "it took up time while they hovered at the bookstall on the restless platform, where the little volumes in a row were all yellow and pink and one of her favourite old women in one of her favourite old caps absolutely wheedled him into the purchase of three. ", "They had thus so much to carry home that it would have seemed simpler, with such a provision for a nice straight journey through France, just to \"nip,\" as she phrased it to herself, into the coup\u00e9 of the train that, a little further along, stood waiting to start. ", "She asked Sir Claude where it was going. \" ", "To Paris. ", "Fancy!\" ", "She could fancy well enough. ", "They stood there and smiled, he with all the newspapers under his arm and she with the three books, one yellow and two pink. ", "He had told her the pink were for herself and the yellow one for Mrs. Beale, implying in an interesting way that these were the natural divisions in France of literature for the young and for the old. ", "She knew how prepared they looked to pass into the train, and she presently brought out to her companion: ", "I wish we could go. ", "Won't you take me?\" ", "He continued to smile. ", "Would you really come?\" ", "\"Oh yes, oh yes. ", "Try.\" ", "\"Do you want me to take our tickets?\" ", "\"Yes, take them.\" ", "\"Without any luggage?\" ", "She showed their two armfuls, smiling at him as he smiled at her, but so conscious of being more frightened than she had ever been in her life that she seemed to see her whiteness as in a glass. ", "Then she knew that what she saw was Sir Claude's whiteness: ", "he was as frightened as herself. ", "Haven't we got plenty of luggage?\" ", "she asked. ", "\" Take the tickets-haven't you time? ", "When does the train go?\" ", "Sir Claude turned to a porter. ", "\" When does the train go?\" ", "The man looked up at the station-clock. ", "In two minutes. ", "Monsieur est plac\u00e9?\" ", "\"Pas encore.\" ", "\"Et vos billets?-vous n'avez que le temps. ", "\" Then after a look at Maisie, \"Monsieur veut-il que je les prenne?\" ", "the man said. ", "Sir Claude turned back to her. ", "\" Veux-tu lieu qu'il en prenne? ", "\" It was the most extraordinary thing in the world: ", "in the intensity of her excitement she not only by illumination understood all their French, but fell into it with an active perfection. ", "She addressed herself straight to the porter. \" ", "Prenny, prenny. ", "Oh prenny!\" ", "\"Ah si mademoiselle le veut-!\" ", "He waited there for the money. ", "But Sir Claude only stared-stared at her with his white face. ", "\" You have chosen then? ", "You'll let her go?\" ", "Maisie carried her eyes wistfully to the train, where, amid cries of \"En voiture, en voiture!\" ", "heads were at windows and doors banging loud. ", "The porter was pressing. ", "\" Ah vous n'avez plus le temps!\" ", "\"It's going-it's going! ", "\" cried Maisie. ", "They watched it move, they watched it start; ", "then the man went his way with a shrug. ", "\" It's gone!\" ", "Sir Claude said. ", "Maisie crept some distance up the platform; ", "she stood there with her back to her companion, following it with her eyes, keeping down tears, nursing her pink and yellow books. ", "She had had a real fright but had fallen back to earth. ", "The odd thing was that in her fall her fear too had been dashed down and broken. ", "It was gone. ", "She looked round at last, from where she had paused, at Sir Claude's, and then saw that his wasn't. ", "It sat there with him on the bench to which, against the wall of the station, he had retreated, and where, leaning back and, as she thought, rather queer, he still waited. ", "She came down to him and he continued to offer his ineffectual intention of pleasantry. ", "\" Yes, I've chosen,\" she said to him. ", "\" I'll let her go if you-if you-\"  She faltered; ", "he quickly took her up. ", "If I, if I-\"  \"If you'll give up Mrs. Beale.\" ", "\"Oh!\" he exclaimed; ", "on which she saw how much, how hopelessly he was afraid. ", "She had supposed at the caf\u00e9 that it was of his rebellion, of his gathering motive; ", "but how could that be when his temptations-that temptation for example of the train they had just lost-were after all so slight? ", "Mrs. Wix was right. ", "He was afraid of his weakness-of his weakness. ", "She couldn't have told you afterwards how they got back to the inn: ", "she could only have told you that even from this point they had not gone straight, but once more had wandered and loitered and, in the course of it, had found themselves on the edge of the quay where-still apparently with half an hour to spare-the boat prepared for Folkestone was drawn up. ", "Here they hovered as they had done at the station; ", "here they exchanged silences again, but only exchanged silences. ", "There were punctual people on the deck, choosing places, taking the best; ", "some of them already contented, all established and shawled, facing to England and attended by the steward, who, confined on such a day to the lighter offices, tucked up the ladies' feet or opened bottles with a pop. ", "They looked down at these things without a word; ", "they even picked out a good place for two that was left in the lee of a lifeboat; ", "and if they lingered rather stupidly, neither deciding to go aboard nor deciding to come away, it was Sir Claude quite as much as she who wouldn't move. ", "It was Sir Claude who cultivated the supreme stillness by which she knew best what he meant. ", "He simply meant that he knew all she herself meant. ", "But there was no pretence of pleasantry now: ", "their faces were grave and tired. ", "When at last they lounged off it was as if his fear, his fear of his weakness, leaned upon her heavily as they followed the harbour. ", "In the hall of the hotel as they passed in she saw a battered old box that she recognised, an ancient receptacle with dangling labels that she knew and a big painted W, lately done over and intensely personal, that seemed to stare at her with a recognition and even with some suspicion of its own. ", "Sir Claude caught it too, and there was agitation for both of them in the sight of this object on the move. ", "Was Mrs. Wix going and was the responsibility of giving her up lifted, at a touch, from her pupil? ", "Her pupil and her pupil's companion, transfixed a moment, held, in the presence of the omen, communication more intense than in the presence either of the Paris train or of the Channel steamer; ", "then, and still without a word, they went straight upstairs. ", "There, however, on the landing, out of sight of the people below, they collapsed so that they had to sink down together for support: ", "they simply seated themselves on the uppermost step while Sir Claude grasped the hand of his stepdaughter with a pressure that at another moment would probably have made her squeal. ", "Their books and papers were all scattered. \" ", "She thinks you've given her up!\" ", "\"Then I must see her-I must see her,\" Maisie said. ", "\"To bid her good-bye?\" ", "\"I must see her-I must see her,\" the child only repeated. ", "They sat a minute longer, Sir Claude, with his tight grip of her hand and looking away from her, looking straight down the staircase to where, round the turn, electric bells rattled and the pleasant sea-draught blew. ", "At last, loosening his grasp, he slowly got up while she did the same. ", "They went together along the lobby, but before they reached the salon he stopped again. ", "\" If I give up Mrs. Beale-?\" \"I'll go straight out with you again and not come back till she has gone.\" ", "He seemed to wonder. \" ", "Till Mrs. Beale-?\" ", "He had made it sound like a bad joke. ", "\"I mean till Mrs. Wix leaves-in that boat.\" ", "Sir Claude looked almost foolish. \" ", "Is she going in that boat?\" ", "\"I suppose so. ", "I won't even bid her good-bye,\" Maisie continued. ", "\" I'll stay out till the boat has gone. ", "I'll go up to the old rampart.\" ", "\"The old rampart?\" ", "\"I'll sit on that old bench where you see the gold Virgin.\" ", "\"The gold Virgin?\" he vaguely echoed. ", "But it brought his eyes back to her as if after an instant he could see the place and the thing she named-could see her sitting there alone. \" ", "While I break with Mrs. Beale?\" ", "\"While you break with Mrs. Beale. ", "He gave a long deep smothered sigh. ", "\" I must see her first.\" ", "\"You won't do as I do? ", "Go out and wait?\" ", "\"Wait?\"-once more he appeared at a loss. \" ", "Till they both have gone,\" Maisie said. ", "\"Giving us up?\" ", "\"Giving us up.\" ", "Oh with what a face for an instant he wondered if that could be! ", "But his wonder the next moment only made him go to the door and, with his hand on the knob, stand as if listening for voices. ", "Maisie listened, but she heard none. ", "All she heard presently was Sir Claude's saying with speculation quite choked off, but so as not to be heard in the salon: ", "\"Mrs. Beale will never go. ", "\" On this he pushed open the door and she went in with him. ", "The salon was empty, but as an effect of their entrance the lady he had just mentioned appeared at the door of the bedroom. \" ", "Is she going? ", "\" he then demanded. ", "Mrs. Beale came forward, closing her door behind her. ", "\" I've had the most extraordinary scene with her. ", "She told me yesterday she'd stay.\" ", "\"And my arrival has altered it?\" ", "\"Oh we took that into account!\" ", "Mrs. Beale was flushed, which was never quite becoming to her, and her face visibly testified to the encounter to which she alluded. ", "Evidently, however, she had not been worsted, and she held up her head and smiled and rubbed her hands as if in sudden emulation of the patronne. ", "\" She promised she'd stay even if you should come.\" ", "\"Then why has she changed?\" ", "\"Because she's a hound. ", "The reason she herself gives is that you've been out too long.\" ", "Sir Claude stared. ", "\" What has that to do with it?\" ", "\"You've been out an age,\" Mrs. Beale continued; ", "I myself couldn't imagine what had become of you. ", "The whole morning,\" she exclaimed, \"and luncheon long since over!\" ", "Sir Claude appeared indifferent to that. \" ", "Did Mrs. Wix go down with you?\" ", "he only asked. ", "\"Not she; ", "she never budged!\"-and Mrs. Beale's flush, to Maisie's vision, deepened. ", "\" She moped there-she didn't so much as come out to me; ", "and when I sent to invite her she simply declined to appear. ", "She said she wanted nothing, and I went down alone. ", "But when I came up, fortunately a little primed\"-and Mrs. Beale smiled a fine smile of battle-\"she was in the field!\" ", "\"And you had a big row?\" ", "\"We had a big row\"-she assented with a frankness as large. \" ", "And while you left me to that sort of thing I should like to know where you were!\" ", "She paused for a reply, but Sir Claude merely looked at Maisie; ", "a movement that promptly quickened her challenge. ", "\" Where the mischief have you been?\" ", "\"You seem to take it as hard as Mrs. Wix,\" Sir Claude returned. ", "\"I take it as I choose to take it, and you don't answer my question.\" ", "He looked again at Maisie-as if for an aid to this effort; ", "whereupon ", "she smiled at her stepmother and offered: ", "\"We've been everywhere.\" ", "Mrs. Beale, however, made her no response, thereby adding to a surprise of which our young lady had already felt the light brush. ", "She had received neither a greeting nor a glance, but perhaps this was not more remarkable than the omission, in respect to Sir Claude, parted with in London two days before, of any sign of a sense of their reunion. ", "Most remarkable of all was Mrs. Beale's announcement of the pledge given by Mrs. Wix and not hitherto revealed to her pupil. ", "Instead of heeding this witness she went on with acerbity: ", "\"It might surely have occurred to you that something would come up.\" ", "Sir Claude looked at his watch. ", "\" I had no idea it was so late, nor that we had been out so long. ", "We weren't hungry. ", "It passed like a flash. ", "What has come up?\" ", "\"Oh that she's disgusted,\" said Mrs. Beale. ", "\"With whom then?\" ", "\"With Maisie. ", "\" Even now she never looked at the child, who stood there equally associated and disconnected. \" ", "For having no moral sense.\" ", "\"How should she have?\" ", "Sir Claude tried again to shine a little at the companion of his walk. ", "\" How at any rate is it proved by her going out with me?\" ", "\"Don't ask me; ", "ask that woman. ", "She drivels when she doesn't rage,\" Mrs. Beale declared. \" ", "And she leaves the child?\" ", "\"She leaves the child,\" said Mrs. Beale with great emphasis and looking more than ever over Maisie's head. ", "In this position suddenly a change came into her face, caused, as the others could the next thing see, by the reappearance of Mrs. Wix in the doorway which, on coming in at Sir Claude's heels, Maisie had left gaping. ", "\" I don't leave the child-I don't, I don't!\" ", "she thundered from the threshold, advancing upon the opposed three but addressing herself directly to Maisie. ", "She was girded-positively harnessed-for departure, arrayed as she had been arrayed on her advent and armed with a small fat rusty reticule which, almost in the manner of a battle-axe, she brandished in support of her words. ", "She had clearly come straight from her room, where Maisie in an instant guessed she had directed the removal of her minor effects. ", "\" I don't leave you till I've given you another chance. ", "Will you come with me? ", "Maisie turned to Sir Claude, who struck her as having been removed to a distance of about a mile. ", "To Mrs. Beale she turned no more than Mrs. Beale had turned: ", "she felt as if already their difference had been disclosed. ", "What had come out about that in the scene between the two women? ", "Enough came out now, at all events, as she put it practically to her stepfather. ", "Will you come? ", "Won't you?\" she enquired as if she had not already seen that she should have to give him up. ", "It was the last flare of her dream. ", "By this time she was afraid of nothing. ", "\"I should think you'd be too proud to ask!\" ", "Mrs. Wix interposed. ", "Mrs. Wix was herself conspicuously too proud. ", "But at the child's words Mrs. Beale had fairly bounded. ", "Come away from me, Maisie? ", "\" It was a wail of dismay and reproach, in which her stepdaughter was astonished to read that she had had no hostile consciousness and that if she had been so actively grand it was not from suspicion, but from strange entanglements of modesty. ", "Sir Claude presented to Mrs. Beale an expression positively sick. \" ", "Don't put it to her that way!\" ", "There had indeed been something in Mrs. Beale's tone, and for a moment our young lady was reminded of the old days in which so many of her friends had been \"compromised.\" ", "This friend blushed; ", "she was before Mrs. Wix, and though she bridled she took the hint. ", "\" No-it isn't the way.\" ", "Then she showed she knew the way. \" ", "Don't be a still bigger fool, dear, but go straight to your room and wait there till I can come to you. ", "\" Maisie made no motion to obey, but Mrs. Wix raised a hand that forestalled every evasion. ", "\" Don't move till you've heard me. ", "I'm going, but I must first understand. ", "Have you lost it again? ", "Maisie surveyed-for the idea of a describable loss-the immensity of space. ", "Then she replied lamely enough: ", "I feel as if I had lost everything.\" ", "Mrs. Wix looked dark. \" ", "Do you mean to say you have lost what we found together with so much difficulty two days ago? ", "\" As her pupil failed of response she continued: ", "Do you mean to say you've already forgotten what we found together? ", "Maisie dimly remembered. ", "\" My moral sense?\" ", "\"Your moral sense. ", "Haven't I, after all, brought it out?\" ", "She spoke as she had never spoken even in the schoolroom and with the book in her hand. ", "It brought back to the child's recollection how she sometimes couldn't repeat on Friday the sentence that had been glib on Wednesday, and she dealt all feebly and ruefully with the present tough passage. ", "Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale stood there like visitors at an \"exam.\" ", "She had indeed an instant a whiff of the faint flower that Mrs. Wix pretended to have plucked and now with such a peremptory hand thrust at her nose. ", "Then it left her, and, as if she were sinking with a slip from a foothold, her arms made a short jerk. ", "What this jerk represented was the spasm within her of something still deeper than a moral sense. ", "She looked at her examiner; ", "she looked at the visitors; ", "she felt the rising of the tears she had kept down at the station. ", "They had nothing-no, distinctly nothing-to do with her moral sense. ", "The only thing was the old flat shameful schoolroom plea. ", "\" I don't know-I don't know.\" ", "\"Then you've lost it.\" ", "Mrs. Wix seemed to close the book as she fixed the straighteners on Sir Claude. ", "\" You've nipped it in the bud. ", "You've killed it when it had begun to live.

", "\" I've not killed anything,\" he said; ", "\"on the contrary I think I've produced life. ", "I don't know what to call it-I haven't even known how decently to deal with it, to approach it; ", "but, whatever it is, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever met-it's exquisite, it's sacred.\" ", "He had his hands in his pockets and, though a trace of the sickness he had just shown perhaps lingered there, his face bent itself with extraordinary gentleness on both the friends he was about to lose. \" ", "Do you know what I came back for?\" ", "he asked of the elder. ", "\"I think I do!\" cried Mrs. Wix, surprisingly un-mollified and with the heat of her late engagement with Mrs. Beale still on her brow.

", "If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post-office. ", "If you know the post-office you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, drop the reins on his hollow-backed bay and drag himself across the brick pavement to the white colonnade; ", "and you must have asked who he was. ", "It was there that, several years ago, I saw him for the first time; ", "and the sight pulled me up sharp. ", "Even then he was the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man. ", "It was not so much his great height that marked him, for the \"natives\" were easily singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: ", "it was the careless powerful look he had, in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain. ", "There was something bleak and unapproachable in his face, and he was so stiffened and grizzled that I took him for an old man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two. ", "I had this from Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage from Bettsbridge to Starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his line. \" ", "He's looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; ", "and that's twenty-four years ago come next February,\" Harmon threw out between reminiscent pauses. ", "The \"smash-up\" it was-I gathered from the same informant-which, besides drawing the red gash across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the few steps from his buggy to the post-office window. ", "He used to drive in from his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for fetching my mail I often passed him in the porch or stood beside him while we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind the grating. ", "I noticed that, though he came so punctually, he seldom received anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he put without a glance into his sagging pocket. ", "At intervals, however, the post-master would hand him an envelope addressed to Mrs. Zenobia-or Mrs. Zeena-Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left-hand corner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name of his specific. ", "These documents my neighbour would also pocket without a glance, as if too much used to them to wonder at their number and variety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master. ", "Every one in Starkfield knew him and gave him a greeting tempered to his own grave mien; ", "but his taciturnity was respected and it was only on rare occasions that one of the older men of the place detained him for a word. ", "When this happened he would listen quietly, his blue eyes on the speaker's face, and answer in so low a tone that his words never reached me; ", "then he would climb stiffly into his buggy, gather up the reins in his left hand and drive slowly away in the direction of his farm. ", "\"It was a pretty bad smash-up?\" ", "I questioned Harmon, looking after Frome's retreating figure, and thinking how gallantly his lean brown head, with its shock of light hair, must have sat on his strong shoulders before they were bent out of shape. \" ", "Wust kind,\" my informant assented. \" ", "More'n enough to kill most men. ", "But the Fromes are tough. ", "Ethan'll likely touch a hundred.\" ", "\"Good God! ", "\" I exclaimed. ", "At the moment Ethan Frome, after climbing to his seat, had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a wooden box-also with a druggist's label on it-which he had placed in the back of the buggy, and I saw his face as it probably looked when he thought himself alone. \" ", "That man touch a hundred? ", "He looks as if he was dead and in hell now!\" ", "Harmon drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket, cut off a wedge and pressed it into the leather pouch of his cheek. ", "Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters. ", "Most of the smart ones get away.\" ", "\"Why didn't he?\" ", "\"Somebody had to stay and care for the folks. ", "There warn't ever anybody but Ethan. ", "Fust his father-then his mother-then his wife.\" ", "\"And then the smash-up?\" ", "Harmon chuckled sardonically. ", "\" That's so. ", "He had to stay then.\" ", "\"I see. ", "And since then they've had to care for him?\" ", "Harmon thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek. ", "Oh, as to that: ", "I guess it's always Ethan done the caring.\" ", "Though Harmon Gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moral reach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts, and I had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps. ", "But one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which I grouped my subsequent inferences: ", "Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters. ", "\" Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant. ", "Yet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and Shadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y. M. C. A. halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation. ", "But when winter shut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life there-or rather its negation-must have been in Ethan Frome's young manhood. ", "I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strike had so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield-the nearest habitable spot-for the best part of the winter. ", "I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life. ", "During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community. ", "Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter. ", "One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; ", "but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield. ", "When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; ", "when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; ", "I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. ", "Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; ", "and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: ", "Most of the smart ones get away. ", "But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome? ", "During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs. Ned Hale. ", "Mrs. Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and \"lawyer Varnum's house,\"  where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village. ", "It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational church. ", "It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; ", "and Mrs. Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house. ", "In the \"best parlour,\" with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle. ", "It was not that Mrs. Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiority to the people about her; ", "it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with detachment. ", "She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome's story, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the facts I knew. ", "Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; ", "but on the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent. ", "There was no hint of disapproval in her reserve; ", "I merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low \"Yes, I knew them both... ", "it was awful... ", "\" seeming to be the utmost concession that her distress could make to my curiosity. ", "So marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case anew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; ", "but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt. ", "\"Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; ", "and, come to think of it, she was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up. ", "It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale. ", "The young folks was all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it. ", "She's had troubles enough of her own. ", "\" All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; ", "and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there. ", "Nevertheless, I might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of Mrs. Hale's silence, and-a little later-for the accident of personal contact with the man. ", "On my arrival at Starkfield, Denis Eady, the rich Irish grocer, who was the proprietor of Starkfield's nearest approach to a livery stable, had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to Corbury Flats, where I had to pick up my train for the Junction. ", "But about the middle of the winter Eady's horses fell ill of a local epidemic. ", "The illness spread to the other Starkfield stables and for a day or two I was put to it to find a means of transport. ", "Then Harmon Gow suggested that Ethan Frome's bay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive me over. ", "I stared at the suggestion. \" ", "Ethan Frome? ", "But I've never even spoken to him. ", "Why on earth should he put himself out for me?\" ", "Harmon's answer surprised me still more. ", "\" I don't know as he would; ", "but I know he wouldn't be sorry to earn a dollar. ", "\" I had been told that Frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the arid acres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his household through the winter; ", "but I had not supposed him to be in such want as Harmon's words implied, and I expressed my wonder. ", "\"Well, matters ain't gone any too well with him,\" Harmon said. ", "\" When a man's been setting round like a hulk for twenty years or more, seeing things that want doing, it eats inter him, and he loses his grit. ", "That Frome farm was always 'bout as bare's a milkpan when the cat's been round; ", "and you know what one of them old water-mills is wuth nowadays. ", "When Ethan could sweat over 'em both from sunup to dark he kinder choked a living out of 'em; ", "but his folks ate up most everything, even then, and I don't see how he makes out now. ", "Fust his father got a kick, out haying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like Bible texts afore he died. ", "Then his mother got queer and dragged along for years as weak as a baby; ", "and his wife Zeena, she's always been the greatest hand at doctoring in the county. ", "Sickness and trouble: ", "that's what Ethan's had his plate full up with, ever since the very first helping. ", "\" The next morning, when I looked out, I saw the hollow-backed bay between the Varnum spruces, and Ethan Frome, throwing back his worn bearskin, made room for me in the sleigh at his side. ", "After that, for a week, he drove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to Starkfield. ", "The distance each way was barely three miles, but the old bay's pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we were nearly an hour on the way. ", "Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reins loosely held in his left hand, his brown seamed profile, under the helmet-like peak of the cap, relieved against the banks of snow like the bronze image of a hero. ", "He never turned his face to mine, or answered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight pleasantries as I ventured. ", "He seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; ", "but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence. ", "I simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters. ", "Only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment; ", "and the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more. ", "Once I happened to speak of an engineering job I had been on the previous year in Florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about us and that in which I had found myself the year before; ", "and to my surprise Frome said suddenly: ", "Yes: ", "I was down there once, and for a good while afterward I could call up the sight of it in winter. ", "But now it's all snowed under.\" ", "He said no more, and I had to guess the rest from the inflection of his voice and his sharp relapse into silence. ", "Another day, on getting into my train at the Flats, I missed a volume of popular science", "I think it was on some recent discoveries in bio-chemistry-which I had carried with me to read on the way. ", "I thought no more about it till I got into the sleigh again that evening, and saw the book in Frome's hand. ", "\"I found it after you were gone,\" he said. ", "I put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usual silence; ", "but as we began to crawl up the long hill from Corbury Flats to the Starkfield ridge I became aware in the dusk that he had turned his face to mine. ", "\"There are things in that book that I didn't know the first word about,\"  he said. ", "I wondered less at his words than at the queer note of resentment in his voice. ", "He was evidently surprised and slightly aggrieved at his own ignorance. \" ", "Does that sort of thing interest you? ", "\" I asked. ", "\"It used to.\" ", "\"There are one or two rather new things in the book: ", "there have been some big strides lately in that particular line of research. ", "\" I waited a moment for an answer that did not come; ", "then I said: ", "If you'd like to look the book through I'd be glad to leave it with you.\" ", "He hesitated, and I had the impression that he felt himself about to yield to a stealing tide of inertia; ", "then, \"Thank you-I'll take it,\" he answered shortly. ", "I hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication between us. ", "Frome was so simple and straightforward that I was sure his curiosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject. ", "Such tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrast more poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs, and I hoped that the chance of giving expression to the latter might at least unseal his lips. ", "But something in his past history, or in his present way of living, had apparently driven him too deeply into himself for any casual impulse to draw him back to his kind. ", "At our next meeting he made no allusion to the book, and our intercourse seemed fated to remain as negative and one-sided as if there had been no break in his reserve. ", "Frome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when one morning I looked out of my window into a thick snow-fall. ", "The height of the white waves massed against the garden-fence and along the wall of the church showed that the storm must have been going on all night, and that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open. ", "I thought it probable that my train would be delayed; ", "but I had to be at the power-house for an hour or two that afternoon, and I decided, if Frome turned up, to push through to the Flats and wait there till my train came in. ", "I don't know why I put it in the conditional, however, for I never doubted that Frome would appear. ", "He was not the kind of man to be turned from his business by any commotion of the elements; ", "and at the appointed hour his sleigh glided up through the snow like a stage-apparition behind thickening veils of gauze. ", "I was getting to know him too well to express either wonder or gratitude at his keeping his appointment; ", "but I exclaimed in surprise as I saw him turn his horse in a direction opposite to that of the Corbury road. ", "\"The railroad's blocked by a freight-train that got stuck in a drift below the Flats,\" he explained, as we jogged off into the stinging whiteness. \" ", "But look here-where are you taking me, then?\" ", "\"Straight to the Junction, by the shortest way,\" he answered, pointing up School House Hill with his whip. \" ", "To the Junction-in this storm? ", "Why, it's a good ten miles!\" ", "\"The bay'll do it if you give him time. ", "You said you had some business there this afternoon. ", "I'll see you get there.\" ", "He said it so quietly that I could only answer: ", "You're doing me the biggest kind of a favour.\" ", "\"That's all right,\" he rejoined. ", "Abreast of the schoolhouse the road forked, and we dipped down a lane to the left, between hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by the weight of the snow. ", "I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of the hill was that of Frome's saw-mill. ", "It looked exanimate enough, with its idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-white spume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load. ", "Frome did not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we began to mount the next slope. ", "About a mile farther, on a road I had never travelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe. ", "Beyond the orchard lay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; ", "and above the fields, huddled against the white immensities of land and sky, one of those lonely New England farm-houses that make the landscape lonelier. ", "\"That's my place,\" said Frome, with a sideway jerk of his lame elbow; ", "and in the distress and oppression of the scene I did not know what to answer. ", "The snow had ceased, and a flash of watery sunlight exposed the house on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness. ", "The black wraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch, and the thin wooden walls, under their worn coat of paint, seemed to shiver in the wind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow. ", "\"The house was bigger in my father's time: ", "I had to take down the 'L,' a while back,\" Frome continued, checking with a twitch of the left rein the bay's evident intention of turning in through the broken-down gate. ", "I saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was partly due to the loss of what is known in New England as the \"L\": ", "that long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the main house, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with the wood-shed and cow-barn. ", "Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image it presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh climate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, it is certain that the \"L\" rather than the house itself seems to be the centre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England farm. ", "Perhaps this connection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles about Starkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome's words, and to see in the diminished dwelling the image of his own shrunken body. ", "\"We're kinder side-tracked here now,\" he added, \"but there was considerable passing before the railroad was carried through to the Flats.\" ", "He roused the lagging bay with another twitch; ", "then, as if the mere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence for any farther pretence of reserve, he went on slowly: ", "I've always set down the worst of mother's trouble to that. ", "When she got the rheumatism so bad she couldn't move around she used to sit up there and watch the road by the hour; ", "and one year, when they was six months mending the Bettsbridge pike after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his stage round this way, she picked up so that she used to get down to the gate most days to see him. ", "But after the trains begun running nobody ever come by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her head what had happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died. ", "\" As we turned into the Corbury road the snow began to fall again, cutting off our last glimpse of the house; ", "and Frome's silence fell with it, letting down between us the old veil of reticence. ", "This time the wind did not cease with the return of the snow. ", "Instead, it sprang up to a gale which now and then, from a tattered sky, flung pale sweeps of sunlight over a landscape chaotically tossed. ", "But the bay was as good as Frome's word, and we pushed on to the Junction through the wild white scene. ", "In the afternoon the storm held off, and the clearness in the west seemed to my inexperienced eye the pledge of a fair evening. ", "I finished my business as quickly as possible, and we set out for Starkfield with a good chance of getting there for supper. ", "But at sunset the clouds gathered again, bringing an earlier night, and the snow began to fall straight and steadily from a sky without wind, in a soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning. ", "It seemed to be a part of the thickening darkness, to be the winter night itself descending on us layer by layer. ", "The small ray of Frome's lantern was soon lost in this smothering medium, in which even his sense of direction, and the bay's homing instinct, finally ceased to serve us. ", "Two or three times some ghostly landmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray, and then was sucked back into the mist; ", "and when we finally regained our road the old horse began to show signs of exhaustion. ", "I felt myself to blame for having accepted Frome's offer, and after a short discussion I persuaded him to let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at the bay's side. ", "In this way we struggled on for another mile or two, and at last reached a point where Frome, peering into what seemed to me formless night, said: ", "That's my gate down yonder. ", "\" The last stretch had been the hardest part of the way. ", "The bitter cold and the heavy going had nearly knocked the wind out of me, and I could feel the horse's side ticking like a clock under my hand. ", "\"Look here, Frome,\" I began, \"there's no earthly use in your going any farther-\" but he interrupted me: ", "\"Nor you neither. ", "There's been about enough of this for anybody. ", "\" I understood that he was offering me a night's shelter at the farm, and without answering I turned into the gate at his side, and followed him to the barn, where I helped him to unharness and bed down the tired horse. ", "When this was done he unhooked the lantern from the sleigh, stepped out again into the night, and called to me over his shoulder: ", "\"This way. ", "Far off above us a square of light trembled through the screen of snow. ", "Staggering along in Frome's wake I floundered toward it, and in the darkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts against the front of the house. ", "Frome scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch, digging a way through the snow with his heavily booted foot. ", "Then he lifted his lantern, found the latch, and led the way into the house. ", "I went after him into a low unlit passage, at the back of which a ladder-like staircase rose into obscurity. ", "On our right a line of light marked the door of the room which had sent its ray across the night; ", "and behind the door I heard a woman's voice droning querulously. ", "Frome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his boots, and set down his lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of furniture in the hall. ", "Then he opened the door. \" ", "Come in,\" he said; ", "and as he spoke the droning voice grew still... ", "It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his story. ", "I    ", "The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. ", "In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires. ", "The moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations. ", "Young Ethan Frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, past the bank and Michael Eady's new brick store and Lawyer Varnum's house with the two black Norway spruces at the gate. ", "Opposite the Varnum gate, where the road fell away toward the Corbury valley, the church reared its slim white steeple and narrow peristyle. ", "As the young man walked toward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall of the building, but from the lower openings, on the side where the ground sloped steeply down to the Corbury road, the light shot its long bars, illuminating many fresh furrows in the track leading to the basement door, and showing, under an adjoining shed, a line of sleighs with heavily blanketed horses. ", "The night was perfectly still, and the air so dry and pure that it gave little sensation of cold. ", "The effect produced on Frome was rather of a complete absence of atmosphere, as though nothing less tenuous than ether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallic dome overhead. ", "\" It's like being in an exhausted receiver,\" he thought. ", "Four or five years earlier he had taken a year's course at a technological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory with a friendly professor of physics; ", "and the images supplied by that experience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totally different associations of thought in which he had since been living. ", "His father's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature end to Ethan's studies; ", "but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things. ", "As he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp. ", "At the end of the village he paused before the darkened front of the church. ", "He stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up and down the street, in which not another figure moved. ", "The pitch of the Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite coasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters; ", "but to-night not a sled darkened the whiteness of the long declivity. ", "The hush of midnight lay on the village, and all its waking life was gathered behind the church windows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with the broad bands of yellow light. ", "The young man, skirting the side of the building, went down the slope toward the basement door. ", "To keep out of range of the revealing rays from within he made a circuit through the untrodden snow and gradually approached the farther angle of the basement wall. ", "Thence, still hugging the shadow, he edged his way cautiously forward to the nearest window, holding back his straight spare body and craning his neck till he got a glimpse of the room. ", "Seen thus, from the pure and frosty darkness in which he stood, it seemed to be seething in a mist of heat. ", "The metal reflectors of the gas-jets sent crude waves of light against the whitewashed walls, and the iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though they were heaving with volcanic fires. ", "The floor was thronged with girls and young men. ", "Down the side wall facing the window stood a row of kitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen. ", "By this time the music had stopped, and the musicians-a fiddler, and the young lady who played the harmonium on Sundays-were hastily refreshing themselves at one corner of the supper-table which aligned its devastated pie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall. ", "The guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set toward the passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with a sprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle of the floor and clapped his hands. ", "The signal took instant effect. ", "The musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers-some already half-muffled for departure-fell into line down each side of the room, the older spectators slipped back to their chairs, and the lively young man, after diving about here and there in the throng, drew forth a girl who had already wound a cherry-coloured \"fascinator\" about her head, and, leading her up to the end of the floor, whirled her down its length to the bounding tune of a Virginia reel. ", "Frome's heart was beating fast. ", "He had been straining for a glimpse of the dark head under the cherry-coloured scarf and it vexed him that another eye should have been quicker than his. ", "The leader of the reel, who looked as if he had Irish blood in his veins, danced well, and his partner caught his fire. ", "As she passed down the line, her light figure swinging from hand to hand in circles of increasing swiftness, the scarf flew off her head and stood out behind her shoulders, and Frome, at each turn, caught sight of her laughing panting lips, the cloud of dark hair about her forehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed points in a maze of flying lines. ", "The dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keep up with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home-stretch; ", "yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end. ", "Now and then he turned his eyes from the girl's face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. ", "Denis Eady was the son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of \"smart\" business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt. ", "His son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood. ", "Hitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; ", "but now he positively invited a horse-whipping. ", "It was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it: ", "that she could lift her rapt face to her dancer's, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel the offence of his look and touch. ", "Frome was in the habit of walking into Starkfield to fetch home his wife's cousin, Mattie Silver, on the rare evenings when some chance of amusement drew her to the village. ", "It was his wife who had suggested, when the girl came to live with them, that such opportunities should be put in her way. ", "Mattie Silver came from Stamford, and when she entered the Fromes' household to act as her cousin Zeena's aid it was thought best, as she came without pay, not to let her feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of a Starkfield farm. ", "But for this-as Frome sardonically reflected-it would hardly have occurred to Zeena to take any thought for the girl's amusement. ", "When his wife first proposed that they should give Mattie an occasional evening out he had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two miles to the village and back after his hard day on the farm; ", "but not long afterward he had reached the point of wishing that Starkfield might give all its nights to revelry. ", "Mattie Silver had lived under his roof for a year, and from early morning till they met at supper he had frequent chances of seeing her; ", "but no moments in her company were comparable to those when, her arm in his, and her light step flying to keep time with his long stride, they walked back through the night to the farm. ", "He had taken to the girl from the first day, when he had driven over to the Flats to meet her, and she had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out, \"You must be Ethan!\" as she jumped down with her bundles, while he reflected, looking over her slight person: ", "She don't look much on housework, but she ain't a fretter, anyhow. ", "\" But it was not only that the coming to his house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth. ", "The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had thought her. ", "She had an eye to see and an ear to hear: ", "he could show her things and tell her things, and taste the bliss of feeling that all he imparted left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will. ", "It was during their night walks back to the farm that he felt most intensely the sweetness of this communion. ", "He had always been more sensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty. ", "His unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful persuasion. ", "But hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent ache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it. ", "He did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege. ", "Then he learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: ", "that at his side, living under his roof and eating his bread, was a creature to whom he could say: ", "That's Orion down yonder; ", "the big fellow to the right is Aldebaran, and the bunch of little ones-like bees swarming-they're the Pleiades... ", "or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time. ", "The fact that admiration for his learning mingled with Mattie's wonder at what he taught was not the least part of his pleasure. ", "And there were other sensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them together with a shock of silent joy: ", "the cold red of sunset behind winter hills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow. ", "When she said to him once: ", "It looks just as if it was painted!\" ", "it seemed to Ethan that the art of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last been found to utter his secret soul....   ", "As he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back with the poignancy of vanished things. ", "Watching Mattie whirl down the floor from hand to hand he wondered how he could ever have thought that his dull talk interested her. ", "To him, who was never gay but in her presence, her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference. ", "The face she lifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, always looked like a window that has caught the sunset. ", "He even noticed two or three gestures which, in his fatuity, he had thought she kept for him: ", "a way of throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out, and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her. ", "The sight made him unhappy, and his unhappiness roused his latent fears. ", "His wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she had grumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl's inefficiency. ", "Zeena had always been what Starkfield called \"sickly,\" and Frome had to admit that, if she were as ailing as she believed, she needed the help of a stronger arm than the one which lay so lightly in his during the night walks to the farm. ", "Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her training had done nothing to remedy the defect. ", "She was quick to learn, but forgetful and dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously. ", "Ethan had an idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant instinct would wake, and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the county; ", "but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her. ", "At first she was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her; ", "but she laughed with him and that made them better friends. ", "He did his best to supplement her unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to light the kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting the mill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day. ", "He even crept down on Saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor after the women had gone to bed; ", "and Zeena, one day, had surprised him at the churn and had turned away silently, with one of her queer looks. ", "Of late there had been other signs of her disfavour, as intangible but more disquieting. ", "One cold winter morning, as he dressed in the dark, his candle flickering in the draught of the ill-fitting window, he had heard her speak from the bed behind him. ", "\"The doctor don't want I should be left without anybody to do for me,\"  she said in her flat whine. ", "He had supposed her to be asleep, and the sound of her voice had startled him, though she was given to abrupt explosions of speech after long intervals of secretive silence. ", "He turned and looked at her where she lay indistinctly outlined under the dark calico quilt, her high-boned face taking a grayish tinge from the whiteness of the pillow. ", "\"Nobody to do for you?\" he repeated. ", "\"If you say you can't afford a hired girl when Mattie goes. ", "Frome turned away again, and taking up his razor stooped to catch the reflection of his stretched cheek in the blotched looking-glass above the wash-stand. ", "\"Why on earth should Mattie go?\" ", "\"Well, when she gets married, I mean,\" his wife's drawl came from behind him. ", "\"Oh, she'd never leave us as long as you needed her,\" he returned, scraping hard at his chin. ", "\"I wouldn't ever have it said that I stood in the way of a poor girl like Mattie marrying a smart fellow like Denis Eady,\" Zeena answered in a tone of plaintive self-effacement. ", "Ethan, glaring at his face in the glass, threw his head back to draw the razor from ear to chin. ", "His hand was steady, but the attitude was an excuse for not making an immediate reply. \" ", "And the doctor don't want I should be left without anybody,\" Zeena continued. ", "\" He wanted I should speak to you about a girl he's heard about, that might come-\"   ", "Ethan laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh. \" ", "Denis Eady! ", "If that's all, I guess there's no such hurry to look round for a girl.\" ", "\"Well, I'd like to talk to you about it,\" said Zeena obstinately. ", "He was getting into his clothes in fumbling haste. \" ", "All right. ", "But I haven't got the time now; ", "I'm late as it is,\" he returned, holding his old silver turnip-watch to the candle. ", "Zeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him in silence while he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his arms into his coat; ", "but as he went toward the door she said, suddenly and incisively: ", "I guess you're always late, now you shave every morning. ", "\" That thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations about Denis Eady. ", "It was a fact that since Mattie Silver's coming he had taken to shaving every day; ", "but his wife always seemed to be asleep when he left her side in the winter darkness, and he had stupidly assumed that she would not notice any change in his appearance. ", "Once or twice in the past he had been faintly disquieted by Zenobia's way of letting things happen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, in a casual phrase, revealing that she had all along taken her notes and drawn her inferences. ", "Of late, however, there had been no room in his thoughts for such vague apprehensions. ", "Zeena herself, from an oppressive reality, had faded into an insubstantial shade. ", "All his life was lived in the sight and sound of Mattie Silver, and he could no longer conceive of its being otherwise. ", "But now, as he stood outside the church, and saw Mattie spinning down the floor with Denis Eady, a throng of disregarded hints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain.... ", "    II   As the dancers poured out of the hall Frome, drawing back behind the projecting storm-door, watched the segregation of the grotesquely muffled groups, in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up a face flushed with food and dancing. ", "The villagers, being afoot, were the first to climb the slope to the main street, while the country neighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under the shed. ", "Ain't you riding, Mattie?\" ", "a woman's voice called back from the throng about the shed, and Ethan's heart gave a jump. ", "From where he stood he could not see the persons coming out of the hall till they had advanced a few steps beyond the wooden sides of the storm-door; ", "but through its cracks he heard a clear voice answer: ", "Mercy no! ", "Not on such a night. ", "\" She was there, then, close to him, only a thin board between. ", "In another moment she would step forth into the night, and his eyes, accustomed to the obscurity, would discern her as clearly as though she stood in daylight. ", "A wave of shyness pulled him back into the dark angle of the wall, and he stood there in silence instead of making his presence known to her. ", "It had been one of the wonders of their intercourse that from the first, she, the quicker, finer, more expressive, instead of crushing him by the contrast, had given him something of her own ease and freedom; ", "but now he felt as heavy and loutish as in his student days, when he had tried to \"jolly\" the Worcester girls at a picnic. ", "He hung back, and she came out alone and paused within a few yards of him. ", "She was almost the last to leave the hall, and she stood looking uncertainly about her as if wondering why he did not show himself. ", "Then a man's figure approached, coming so close to her that under their formless wrappings they seemed merged in one dim outline. ", "\"Gentleman friend gone back on you? ", "Say, Matt, that's tough! ", "No, I wouldn't be mean enough to tell the other girls. ", "I ain't as low-down as that.\" ", "( How Frome hated his cheap banter!) ", "\" But look at here, ain't it lucky ", "I got the old man's cutter down there waiting for us?\" ", "Frome heard the girl's voice, gaily incredulous: ", "What on earth's your father's cutter doin' down there?\" ", "\"Why, waiting for me to take a ride. ", "I got the roan colt too. ", "I kinder knew I'd want to take a ride to-night,\" Eady, in his triumph, tried to put a sentimental note into his bragging voice. ", "The girl seemed to waver, and Frome saw her twirl the end of her scarf irresolutely about her fingers. ", "Not for the world would he have made a sign to her, though it seemed to him that his life hung on her next gesture. ", "\"Hold on a minute while I unhitch the colt,\" Denis called to her, springing toward the shed. ", "She stood perfectly still, looking after him, in an attitude of tranquil expectancy torturing to the hidden watcher. ", "Frome noticed that she no longer turned her head from side to side, as though peering through the night for another figure. ", "She let Denis Eady lead out the horse, climb into the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her at his side; ", "then, with a swift motion of flight, she turned about and darted up the slope toward the front of the church. ", "Good-bye! ", "Hope you'll have a lovely ride! ", "she called back to him over her shoulder. ", "Denis laughed, and gave the horse a cut that brought him quickly abreast of her retreating figure. ", "\"Come along! ", "Get in quick! ", "It's as slippery as thunder on this turn,\" he cried, leaning over to reach out a hand to her. ", "She laughed back at him: ", "Good-night! ", "I'm not getting in. ", "\" By this time they had passed beyond Frome's earshot and he could only follow the shadowy pantomime of their silhouettes as they continued to move along the crest of the slope above him. ", "He saw Eady, after a moment, jump from the cutter and go toward the girl with the reins over one arm. ", "The other he tried to slip through hers; ", "but she eluded him nimbly, and Frome's heart, which had swung out over a black void, trembled back to safety. ", "A moment later he heard the jingle of departing sleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the empty expanse of snow before the church. ", "In the black shade of the Varnum spruces he caught up with her and she turned with a quick \"Oh!\" ", "\"Think I'd forgotten you, Matt?\" ", "he asked with sheepish glee. ", "She answered seriously: ", "I thought maybe you couldn't come back for me.\" ", "\"Couldn't? ", "What on earth could stop me?\" ", "\"I knew Zeena wasn't feeling any too good to-day.\" ", "\"Oh, she's in bed long ago.\" ", "He paused, a question struggling in him. \" ", "Then you meant to walk home all alone?\" ", "\"Oh, I ain't afraid! ", "\" she laughed. ", "They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and grey under the stars. ", "He brought his question out. ", "\"If you thought I hadn't come, why didn't you ride back with Denis Eady?\" ", "\"Why, where were you? ", "How did you know? ", "I never saw you!\" ", "Her wonder and his laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw. ", "Ethan had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious. ", "To prolong the effect he groped for a dazzling phrase, and brought out, in a growl of rapture: ", "\"Come along.\" ", "He slipped an arm through hers, as Eady had done, and fancied it was faintly pressed against her side, but neither of them moved. ", "It was so dark under the spruces that he could barely see the shape of her head beside his shoulder. ", "He longed to stoop his cheek and rub it against her scarf. ", "He would have liked to stand there with her all night in the blackness. ", "She moved forward a step or two and then paused again above the dip of the Corbury road. ", "Its icy slope, scored by innumerable runners, looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn. ", "\"There was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set,\" she said. ", "\"Would you like to come in and coast with them some night?\" ", "he asked. ", "\"Oh, would you, Ethan? ", "It would be lovely!\" ", "\"We'll come to-morrow if there's a moon.\" ", "She lingered, pressing closer to his side. ", "\" Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum came just as near running into the big elm at the bottom. ", "We were all sure they were killed.\" ", "Her shiver ran down his arm. ", "\" Wouldn't it have been too awful? ", "They're so happy!\" ", "\"Oh, Ned ain't much at steering. ", "I guess I can take you down all right!\" ", "he said disdainfully. ", "He was aware that he was \"talking big,\" like Denis Eady; ", "but his reaction of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which she had said of the engaged couple \"They're so happy!\" ", "made the words sound as if she had been thinking of herself and him. ", "\"The elm is dangerous, though. ", "It ought to be cut down,\" she insisted. ", "\"Would you be afraid of it, with me?\" ", "\"I told you I ain't the kind to be afraid\" she tossed back, almost indifferently; ", "and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step. ", "These alterations of mood were the despair and joy of Ethan Frome. ", "The motions of her mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in the branches. ", "The fact that he had no right to show his feelings, and thus provoke the expression of hers, made him attach a fantastic importance to every change in her look and tone. ", "Now he thought she understood him, and feared; ", "now he was sure she did not, and despaired. ", "To-night the pressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward despair, and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush of joy into which she had plunged him by dismissing Denis Eady. ", "He mounted School House Hill at her side and walked on in silence till they reached the lane leading to the saw-mill; ", "then the need of some definite assurance grew too strong for him. ", "\"You'd have found me right off if you hadn't gone back to have that last reel with Denis,\" he brought out awkwardly. ", "He could not pronounce the name without a stiffening of the muscles of his throat. ", "\"Why, Ethan, how could I tell you were there?\" ", "\"I suppose what folks say is true,\" he jerked out at her, instead of answering. ", "She stopped short, and he felt, in the darkness, that her face was lifted quickly to his. ", "\" Why, what do folks say?\" ", "\"It's natural enough you should be leaving us\" he floundered on, following his thought. \" ", "Is that what they say? ", "\" she mocked back at him; ", "then, with a sudden drop of her sweet treble: ", "\"You mean that Zeena-ain't suited with me any more?\" ", "she faltered. ", "Their arms had slipped apart and they stood motionless, each seeking to distinguish the other's face. ", "\"I know I ain't anything like as smart as I ought to be,\" she went on, while he vainly struggled for expression. ", "\" There's lots of things a hired girl could do that come awkward to me still-and I haven't got much strength in my arms. ", "But if she'd only tell me I'd try. ", "You know she hardly ever says anything, and sometimes I can see she ain't suited, and yet I don't know why. ", "She turned on him with a sudden flash of indignation. ", "\" You'd ought to tell me, Ethan Frome-you'd ought to! ", "Unless you want me to go too-\"   ", "Unless he wanted her to go too! ", "The cry was balm to his raw wound. ", "The iron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness. ", "Again he struggled for the all-expressive word, and again, his arm in hers, found only a deep \"Come along.\" ", "They walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shaded lane, where Ethan's sawmill gloomed through the night, and out again into the comparative clearness of the fields. ", "On the farther side of the hemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars. ", "Sometimes their way led them under the shade of an overhanging bank or through the thin obscurity of a clump of leafless trees. ", "Here and there a farmhouse stood far back among the fields, mute and cold as a grave-stone. ", "The night was so still that they heard the frozen snow crackle under their feet. ", "The crash of a loaded branch falling far off in the woods reverberated like a musket-shot, and once a fox barked, and Mattie shrank closer to Ethan, and quickened her steps. ", "At length they sighted the group of larches at Ethan's gate, and as they drew near it the sense that the walk was over brought back his words. ", "Then you don't want to leave us, Matt?\" ", "He had to stoop his head to catch her stifled whisper: ", "\"Where'd I go, if I did? ", "\" The answer sent a pang through him but the tone suffused him with joy. ", "He forgot what else he had meant to say and pressed her against him so closely that he seemed to feel her warmth in his veins. ", "\"You ain't crying are you, Matt?\" ", "\"No, of course I'm not,\" she quavered. ", "They turned in at the gate and passed under the shaded knoll where, enclosed in a low fence, the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow. ", "Ethan looked at them curiously. ", "For years that quiet company had mocked his restlessness, his desire for change and freedom. ", "\"We never got away-how should you?\" seemed to be written on every headstone; ", "and whenever he went in or out of his gate he thought with a shiver: ", "I shall just go on living here till I join them. ", "\" But now all desire for change had vanished, and the sight of the little enclosure gave him a warm sense of continuance and stability. ", "\"I guess we'll never let you go, Matt,\" he whispered, as though even the dead, lovers once, must conspire with him to keep her; ", "and ", "brushing by the graves, he thought: ", "We'll always go on living here together, and some day she'll lie there beside me.\" ", "He let the vision possess him as they climbed the hill to the house. ", "He was never so happy with her as when he abandoned himself to these dreams. ", "Half-way up the slope Mattie stumbled against some unseen obstruction and clutched his sleeve to steady herself. ", "The wave of warmth that went through him was like the prolongation of his vision. ", "For the first time he stole his arm about her, and she did not resist. ", "They walked on as if they were floating on a summer stream. ", "Zeena always went to bed as soon as she had had her supper, and the shutterless windows of the house were dark. ", "A dead cucumber-vine dangled from the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death, and the thought flashed through Ethan's brain: ", "\"If it was there for Zeena-\"  Then he had a distinct sight of his wife lying in their bedroom asleep, her mouth slightly open, her false teeth in a tumbler by the bed... ", "They walked around to the back of the house, between the rigid gooseberry bushes. ", "It was Zeena's habit, when they came back late from the village, to leave the key of the kitchen door under the mat. ", "Ethan stood before the door, his head heavy with dreams, his arm still about Mattie. \" ", "Matt-\" he began, not knowing what he meant to say. ", "She slipped out of his hold without speaking, and he stooped down and felt for the key. ", "\"It's not there!\" ", "he said, straightening himself with a start. ", "They strained their eyes at each other through the icy darkness. ", "Such a thing had never happened before. ", "\"Maybe she's forgotten it,\" Mattie said in a tremulous whisper; ", "but both of them knew that it was not like Zeena to forget. ", "\"It might have fallen off into the snow,\" Mattie continued, after a pause during which they had stood intently listening. \" ", "It must have been pushed off, then,\" he rejoined in the same tone. ", "Another wild thought tore through him. ", "What if tramps had been there-what if... ", "Again he listened, fancying he heard a distant sound in the house; ", "then he felt in his pocket for a match, and kneeling down, passed its light slowly over the rough edges of snow about the doorstep. ", "He was still kneeling when his eyes, on a level with the lower panel of the door, caught a faint ray beneath it. ", "Who could be stirring in that silent house? ", "He heard a step on the stairs, and again for an instant the thought of tramps tore through him. ", "Then the door opened and he saw his wife. ", "Against the dark background of the kitchen she stood up tall and angular, one hand drawing a quilted counterpane to her flat breast, while the other held a lamp. ", "The light, on a level with her chin, drew out of the darkness her puckered throat and the projecting wrist of the hand that clutched the quilt, and deepened fantastically the hollows and prominences of her high-boned face under its ring of crimping-pins. ", "To Ethan, still in the rosy haze of his hour with Mattie, the sight came with the intense precision of the last dream before waking. ", "He felt as if he had never before known what his wife looked like. ", "She drew aside without speaking, and Mattie and Ethan passed into the kitchen, which had the deadly chill of a vault after the dry cold of the night. ", "Guess you forgot about us, Zeena,\" Ethan joked, stamping the snow from his boots. ", "No. ", "I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep. ", "Mattie came forward, unwinding her wraps, the colour of the cherry scarf in her fresh lips and cheeks. ", "\" I'm so sorry, Zeena! ", "Isn't there anything I can do?\" ", "\"No; ", "there's nothing.\" ", "Zeena turned away from her. ", "\" You might 'a' shook off that snow outside,\" she said to her husband. ", "She walked out of the kitchen ahead of them and pausing in the hall raised the lamp at arm's-length, as if to light them up the stairs. ", "Ethan paused also, affecting to fumble for the peg on which he hung his coat and cap. ", "The doors of the two bedrooms faced each other across the narrow upper landing, and to-night it was peculiarly repugnant to him that Mattie should see him follow Zeena. ", "\"I guess I won't come up yet awhile,\" he said, turning as if to go back to the kitchen. ", "Zeena stopped short and looked at him. ", "For the land's sake-what you going to do down here?\" ", "\"I've got the mill accounts to go over.\" ", "She continued to stare at him, the flame of the unshaded lamp bringing out with microscopic cruelty the fretful lines of her face. ", "At this time o' night? ", "You'll ketch your death. ", "The fire's out long ago. ", "Without answering he moved away toward the kitchen. ", "As he did so his glance crossed Mattie's and he fancied that a fugitive warning gleamed through her lashes. ", "The next moment they sank to her flushed cheeks and she began to mount the stairs ahead of Zeena. ", "\"That's so. ", "It is powerful cold down here,\" Ethan assented; ", "and with lowered head he went up in his wife's wake, and followed her across the threshold of their room. ", "III    ", "There was some hauling to be done at the lower end of the wood-lot, and Ethan was out early the next day. ", "The winter morning was as clear as crystal. ", "The sunrise burned red in a pure sky, the shadows on the rim of the wood-lot were darkly blue, and beyond the white and scintillating fields patches of far-off forest hung like smoke. ", "It was in the early morning stillness, when his muscles were swinging to their familiar task and his lungs expanding with long draughts of mountain air, that Ethan did his clearest thinking. ", "He and Zeena had not exchanged a word after the door of their room had closed on them. ", "She had measured out some drops from a medicine-bottle on a chair by the bed and, after swallowing them, and wrapping her head in a piece of yellow flannel, had lain down with her face turned away. ", "Ethan undressed hurriedly and blew out the light so that he should not see her when he took his place at her side. ", "As he lay there he could hear Mattie moving about in her room, and her candle, sending its small ray across the landing, drew a scarcely perceptible line of light under his door. ", "He kept his eyes fixed on the light till it vanished. ", "Then the room grew perfectly black, and not a sound was audible but Zeena's asthmatic breathing. ", "Ethan felt confusedly that there were many things he ought to think about, but through his tingling veins and tired brain only one sensation throbbed: ", "the warmth of Mattie's shoulder against his. ", "Why had he not kissed her when he held her there? ", "A few hours earlier he would not have asked himself the question. ", "Even a few minutes earlier, when they had stood alone outside the house, he would not have dared to think of kissing her. ", "But since he had seen her lips in the lamplight he felt that they were his. ", "Now, in the bright morning air, her face was still before him. ", "It was part of the sun's red and of the pure glitter on the snow. ", "How the girl had changed since she had come to Starkfield! ", "He remembered what a colourless slip of a thing she had looked the day he had met her at the station. ", "And all the first winter, how she had shivered with cold when the northerly gales shook the thin clapboards and the snow beat like hail against the loose-hung windows! ", "He had been afraid that she would hate the hard life, the cold and loneliness; ", "but not a sign of discontent escaped her. ", "Zeena took the view that Mattie was bound to make the best of Starkfield since she hadn't any other place to go to; ", "but this did not strike Ethan as conclusive. ", "Zeena, at any rate, did not apply the principle in her own case. ", "He felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had, in a sense, indentured her to them. ", "Mattie Silver was the daughter of a cousin of Zenobia Frome's, who had inflamed his clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to Connecticut, where he had married a Stamford girl and succeeded to her father's thriving \"drug\" business. ", "Unhappily Orin Silver, a man of far-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means. ", "His accounts revealed merely what the means had been; ", "and these were such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his books were examined only after his impressive funeral. ", "His wife died of the disclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her way on the fifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano. ", "For this purpose her equipment, though varied, was inadequate. ", "She could trim a hat, make molasses candy, recite \"Curfew shall not ring to-night,\" and play \"The Lost Chord\" and a pot-pourri from \"Carmen. ", "When she tried to extend the field of her activities in the direction of stenography and book-keeping her health broke down, and six months on her feet behind the counter of a department store did not tend to restore it. ", "Her nearest relations had been induced to place their savings in her father's hands, and though, after his death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christian duty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the advice at their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it by material aid. ", "But when Zenobia's doctor recommended her looking about for some one to help her with the house-work the clan instantly saw the chance of exacting a compensation from Mattie. ", "Zenobia, though doubtful of the girl's efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find fault without much risk of losing her; ", "and so Mattie came to Starkfield. ", "Zenobia's fault-finding was of the silent kind, but not the less penetrating for that. ", "During the first months Ethan alternately burned with the desire to see Mattie defy her and trembled with fear of the result. ", "Then the situation grew less strained. ", "The pure air, and the long summer hours in the open, gave back life and elasticity to Mattie, and Zeena, with more leisure to devote to her complex ailments, grew less watchful of the girl's omissions; ", "so that Ethan, struggling on under the burden of his barren farm and failing saw-mill, could at least imagine that peace reigned in his house. ", "There was really, even now, no tangible evidence to the contrary; ", "but since the previous night a vague dread had hung on his sky-line. ", "It was formed of Zeena's obstinate silence, of Mattie's sudden look of warning, of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which told him, on certain stainless mornings, that before night there would be rain. ", "His dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty. ", "The hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be delivered to Andrew Hale, the Starkfield builder, it was really easier for Ethan to send Jotham Powell, the hired man, back to the farm on foot, and drive the load down to the village himself. ", "He had scrambled up on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggy grays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had a vision of the warning look that Mattie had given him the night before. ", "\"If there's going to be any trouble I want to be there,\" was his vague reflection, as he threw to Jotham the unexpected order to unhitch the team and lead them back to the barn. ", "It was a slow trudge home through the heavy fields, and when the two men entered the kitchen Mattie was lifting the coffee from the stove and Zeena was already at the table. ", "Her husband stopped short at sight of her. ", "Instead of her usual calico wrapper and knitted shawl she wore her best dress of brown merino, and above her thin strands of hair, which still preserved the tight undulations of the crimping-pins, rose a hard perpendicular bonnet, as to which Ethan's clearest notion was that he had to pay five dollars for it at the Bettsbridge Emporium. ", "On the floor beside her stood his old valise and a bandbox wrapped in newspapers. ", "\"Why, where are you going, Zeena?\" he exclaimed. ", "\"I've got my shooting pains so bad that I'm going over to Bettsbridge to spend the night with Aunt Martha Pierce and see that new doctor,\" she answered in a matter-of-fact tone, as if she had said she was going into the store-room to take a look at the preserves, or up to the attic to go over the blankets. ", "In spite of her sedentary habits such abrupt decisions were not without precedent in Zeena's history. ", "Twice or thrice before she had suddenly packed Ethan's valise and started off to Bettsbridge, or even Springfield, to seek the advice of some new doctor, and her husband had grown to dread these expeditions because of their cost. ", "Zeena always came back laden with expensive remedies, and her last visit to Springfield had been commemorated by her paying twenty dollars for an electric battery of which she had never been able to learn the use. ", "But for the moment his sense of relief was so great as to preclude all other feelings. ", "He had now no doubt that Zeena had spoken the truth in saying, the night before, that she had sat up because she felt \"too mean\" to sleep: ", "her abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that, as usual, she was wholly absorbed in her health. ", "As if expecting a protest, she continued plaintively; ", "If you're too busy with the hauling I presume you can let Jotham Powell drive me over with the sorrel in time to ketch the train at the Flats.\" ", "Her husband hardly heard what she was saying. ", "During the winter months there was no stage between Starkfield and Bettsbridge, and the trains which stopped at Corbury Flats were slow and infrequent. ", "A rapid calculation showed Ethan that Zeena could not be back at the farm before the following evening....   ", "\"If I'd supposed you'd 'a' made any objection to Jotham Powell's driving me over-\" she began again, as though his silence had implied refusal. ", "On the brink of departure she was always seized with a flux of words. ", "\" All I know is,\" she continued, \"I can't go on the way I am much longer. ", "The pains are clear away down to my ankles now, or I'd 'a' walked in to Starkfield on my own feet, sooner'n put you out, and asked Michael Eady to let me ride over on his wagon to the Flats, when he sends to meet the train that brings his groceries. ", "I'd 'a' had two hours to wait in the station, but I'd sooner 'a' done it, even with this cold, than to have you say-\"  \"Of course Jotham'll drive you over,\" Ethan roused himself to answer. ", "He became suddenly conscious that he was looking at Mattie while Zeena talked to him, and with an effort he turned his eyes to his wife. ", "She sat opposite the window, and the pale light reflected from the banks of snow made her face look more than usually drawn and bloodless, sharpened the three parallel creases between ear and cheek, and drew querulous lines from her thin nose to the corners of her mouth. ", "Though she was but seven years her husband's senior, and he was only twenty-eight, she was already an old woman. ", "Ethan tried to say something befitting the occasion, but there was only one thought in his mind: ", "the fact that, for the first time since Mattie had come to live with them, Zeena was to be away for a night. ", "He wondered if the girl were thinking of it too....   ", "He knew that Zeena must be wondering why he did not offer to drive her to the Flats and let Jotham Powell take the lumber to Starkfield, and at first he could not think of a pretext for not doing so; ", "then he said: ", "I'd take you over myself, only I've got to collect the cash for the lumber. ", "As soon as the words were spoken he regretted them, not only because they were untrue-there being no prospect of his receiving cash payment from Hale-but also because he knew from experience the imprudence of letting Zeena think he was in funds on the eve of one of her therapeutic excursions. ", "At the moment, however, his one desire was to avoid the long drive with her behind the ancient sorrel who never went out of a walk. ", "Zeena made no reply: ", "she did not seem to hear what he had said. ", "She had already pushed her plate aside, and was measuring out a draught from a large bottle at her elbow. ", "\"It ain't done me a speck of good, but I guess I might as well use it up,\" she remarked; ", "adding, as she pushed the empty bottle toward Mattie: ", "If you can get the taste out it'll do for pickles. ", "\" IV   As soon as his wife had driven off Ethan took his coat and cap from the peg. ", "Mattie was washing up the dishes, humming one of the dance tunes of the night before. ", "He said \"So long, Matt,\" and she answered gaily \"So long, Ethan\"; ", "and that was all. ", "It was warm and bright in the kitchen. ", "The sun slanted through the south window on the girl's moving figure, on the cat dozing in a chair, and on the geraniums brought in from the door-way, where Ethan had planted them in the summer to \"make a garden\" for Mattie. ", "He would have liked to linger on, watching her tidy up and then settle down to her sewing; ", "but he wanted still more to get the hauling done and be back at the farm before night. ", "All the way down to the village he continued to think of his return to Mattie. ", "The kitchen was a poor place, not \"spruce\" and shining as his mother had kept it in his boyhood; ", "but it was surprising what a homelike look the mere fact of Zeena's absence gave it. ", "And he pictured what it would be like that evening, when he and Mattie were there after supper. ", "For the first time they would be alone together indoors, and they would sit there, one on each side of the stove, like a married couple, he in his stocking feet and smoking his pipe, she laughing and talking in that funny way she had, which was always as new to him as if he had never heard her before. ", "The sweetness of the picture, and the relief of knowing that his fears of \"trouble\" with Zeena were unfounded, sent up his spirits with a rush, and he, who was usually so silent, whistled and sang aloud as he drove through the snowy fields. ", "There was in him a slumbering spark of sociability which the long Starkfield winters had not yet extinguished. ", "By nature grave and inarticulate, he admired recklessness and gaiety in others and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse. ", "At Worcester, though he had the name of keeping to himself and not being much of a hand at a good time, he had secretly gloried in being clapped on the back and hailed as \"Old Ethe\" or \"Old Stiff\"; ", "and the cessation of such familiarities had increased the chill of his return to Starkfield. ", "There the silence had deepened about him year by year. ", "Left alone, after his father's accident, to carry the burden of farm and mill, he had had no time for convivial loiterings in the village; ", "and when his mother fell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than that of the fields. ", "His mother had been a talker in her day, but after her \"trouble\" the sound of her voice was seldom heard, though she had not lost the power of speech. ", "Sometimes, in the long winter evenings, when in desperation her son asked her why she didn't \"say something,\" she would lift a finger and answer: ", "Because I'm listening\"; ", "and on stormy nights, when the loud wind was about the house, she would complain, if he spoke to her: ", "They're talking so out there that I can't hear you. ", "\" It was only when she drew toward her last illness, and his cousin Zenobia Pierce came over from the next valley to help him nurse her, that human speech was heard again in the house. ", "After the mortal silence of his long imprisonment Zeena's volubility was music in his ears. ", "He felt that he might have \"gone like his mother\" if the sound of a new voice had not come to steady him. ", "Zeena seemed to understand his case at a glance. ", "She laughed at him for not knowing the simplest sick-bed duties and told him to \"go right along out\" and leave her to see to things. ", "The mere fact of obeying her orders, of feeling free to go about his business again and talk with other men, restored his shaken balance and magnified his sense of what he owed her. ", "Her efficiency shamed and dazzled him. ", "She seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdom that his long apprenticeship had not instilled in him. ", "When the end came it was she who had to tell him to hitch up and go for the undertaker, and she thought it \"funny\" that he had not settled beforehand who was to have his mother's clothes and the sewing-machine. ", "After the funeral, when he saw her preparing to go away, he was seized with an unreasoning dread of being left alone on the farm; ", "and before he knew what he was doing he had asked her to stay there with him. ", "He had often thought since that it would not have happened if his mother had died in spring instead of winter... ", "When they married it was agreed that, as soon as he could straighten out the difficulties resulting from Mrs. Frome's long illness, they would sell the farm and saw-mill and try their luck in a large town. ", "Ethan's love of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture. ", "He had always wanted to be an engineer, and to live in towns, where there were lectures and big libraries and \"fellows doing things.\" ", "A slight engineering job in Florida, put in his way during his period of study at Worcester, increased his faith in his ability as well as his eagerness to see the world; ", "and he felt sure that, with a \"smart\" wife like Zeena, it would not be long before he had made himself a place in it. ", "Zeena's native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railway than Starkfield, and she had let her husband see from the first that life on an isolated farm was not what she had expected when she married. ", "But purchasers were slow in coming, and while he waited for them Ethan learned the impossibility of transplanting her. ", "She chose to look down on Starkfield, but she could not have lived in a place which looked down on her. ", "Even Bettsbridge or Shadd's Falls would not have been sufficiently aware of her, and in the greater cities which attracted Ethan she would have suffered a complete loss of identity. ", "And within a year of their marriage she developed the \"sickliness\" which had since made her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances. ", "When she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to Ethan like the very genius of health, but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse had been acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms. ", "Then she too fell silent. ", "Perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life on the farm, or perhaps, as she sometimes said, it was because Ethan \"never listened.\" ", "The charge was not wholly unfounded. ", "When she spoke it was only to complain, and to complain of things not in his power to remedy; ", "and to check a tendency to impatient retort he had first formed the habit of not answering her, and finally of thinking of other things while she talked. ", "Of late, however, since he had reasons for observing her more closely, her silence had begun to trouble him. ", "He recalled his mother's growing taciturnity, and wondered if Zeena were also turning \"queer.\" ", "Women did, he knew. ", "Zeena, who had at her fingers' ends the pathological chart of the whole region, had cited many cases of the kind while she was nursing his mother; ", "and he himself knew of certain lonely farm-houses in the neighbourhood where stricken creatures pined, and of others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence. ", "At times, looking at Zeena's shut face, he felt the chill of such forebodings. ", "At other times her silence seemed deliberately assumed to conceal far-reaching intentions, mysterious conclusions drawn from suspicions and resentments impossible to guess. ", "That supposition was even more disturbing than the other; ", "and it was the one which had come to him the night before, when he had seen her standing in the kitchen door. ", "Now her departure for Bettsbridge had once more eased his mind, and all his thoughts were on the prospect of his evening with Mattie. ", "Only one thing weighed on him, and that was his having told Zeena that he was to receive cash for the lumber. ", "He foresaw so clearly the consequences of this imprudence that with considerable reluctance he decided to ask Andrew Hale for a small advance on his load. ", "When Ethan drove into Hale's yard the builder was just getting out of his sleigh. ", "\"Hello, Ethe!\" he said. ", "\" This comes handy.\" ", "Andrew Hale was a ruddy man with a big gray moustache and a stubbly double-chin unconstrained by a collar; ", "but his scrupulously clean shirt was always fastened by a small diamond stud. ", "This display of opulence was misleading, for though he did a fairly good business it was known that his easygoing habits and the demands of his large family frequently kept him what Starkfield called \"behind.\" ", "He was an old friend of Ethan's family, and his house one of the few to which Zeena occasionally went, drawn there by the fact that Mrs. Hale, in her youth, had done more \"doctoring\" than any other woman in Starkfield, and was still a recognised authority on symptoms and treatment. ", "Hale went up to the grays and patted their sweating flanks. ", "\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"you keep them two as if they was pets.\" ", "Ethan set about unloading the logs and when he had finished his job he pushed open the glazed door of the shed which the builder used as his office. ", "Hale sat with his feet up on the stove, his back propped against a battered desk strewn with papers: ", "the place, like the man, was warm, genial and untidy. ", "\"Sit right down and thaw out,\" he greeted Ethan. ", "The latter did not know how to begin, but at length he managed to bring out his request for an advance of fifty dollars. ", "The blood rushed to his thin skin under the sting of Hale's astonishment. ", "It was the builder's custom to pay at the end of three months, and there was no precedent between the two men for a cash settlement. ", "Ethan felt that if he had pleaded an urgent need Hale might have made shift to pay him; ", "but pride, and an instinctive prudence, kept him from resorting to this argument. ", "After his father's death it had taken time to get his head above water, and he did not want Andrew Hale, or any one else in Starkfield, to think he was going under again. ", "Besides, he hated lying; ", "if he wanted the money he wanted it, and it was nobody's business to ask why. ", "He therefore made his demand with the awkwardness of a proud man who will not admit to himself that he is stooping; ", "and he was not much surprised at Hale's refusal. ", "The builder refused genially, as he did everything else: ", "he treated the matter as something in the nature of a practical joke, and wanted to know if Ethan meditated buying a grand piano or adding a \"cupolo\" to his house; ", "offering, in the latter case, to give his services free of cost. ", "Ethan's arts were soon exhausted, and after an embarrassed pause he wished Hale good day and opened the door of the office. ", "As he passed out the builder suddenly called after him: ", "See here-you ain't in a tight place, are you?\" ", "\"Not a bit,\" Ethan's pride retorted before his reason had time to intervene. ", "\"Well, that's good! ", "Because I am, a shade. ", "Fact is, I was going to ask you to give me a little extra time on that payment. ", "Business is pretty slack, to begin with, and then I'm fixing up a little house for Ned and Ruth when they're married. ", "I'm glad to do it for 'em, but it costs. ", "His look appealed to Ethan for sympathy. ", "\" The young people like things nice. ", "You know how it is yourself: ", "it's not so long ago since you fixed up your own place for Zeena.\" ", "Ethan left the grays in Hale's stable and went about some other business in the village. ", "As he walked away the builder's last phrase lingered in his ears, and he reflected grimly that his seven years with Zeena seemed to Starkfield \"not so long.\" ", "The afternoon was drawing to an end, and here and there a lighted pane spangled the cold gray dusk and made the snow look whiter. ", "The bitter weather had driven every one indoors and Ethan had the long rural street to himself. ", "Suddenly he heard the brisk play of sleigh-bells and a cutter passed him, drawn by a free-going horse. ", "Ethan recognised Michael Eady's roan colt, and young Denis Eady, in a handsome new fur cap, leaned forward and waved a greeting. ", "Hello, Ethe!\" ", "he shouted and spun on. ", "The cutter was going in the direction of the Frome farm, and Ethan's heart contracted as he listened to the dwindling bells.

", "Ethan was ashamed of the storm of jealousy in his breast. ", "It seemed unworthy of the girl that his thoughts of her should be so violent. ", "He walked on to the church corner and entered the shade of the Varnum spruces, where he had stood with her the night before. ", "As he passed into their gloom he saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him. ", "At his approach it melted for an instant into two separate shapes and then conjoined again, and he heard a kiss, and a half-laughing \"Oh!\" provoked by the discovery of his presence.

", "What did it matter to Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum if they were caught kissing each other? ", "Everybody in Starkfield knew they were engaged. ", "It pleased Ethan to have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he and Mattie had stood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts; ", "but he felt a pang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness. ", "He fetched the grays from Hale's stable and started on his long climb back to the farm. ", "The cold was less sharp than earlier in the day and a thick fleecy sky threatened snow for the morrow.

", "In an hour or two the moon would push over the ridge behind the farm, burn a gold-edged rent in the clouds, and then be swallowed by them. ", "A mournful peace hung on the fields, as though they felt the relaxing grasp of the cold and stretched themselves in their long winter sleep. ", "Ethan's ears were alert for the jingle of sleigh-bells, but not a sound broke the silence of the lonely road. ", "As he drew near the farm he saw, through the thin screen of larches at the gate, a light twinkling in the house above him. ", "\" She's up in her room,\" he said to himself, \"fixing herself up for supper\"; ", "and he remembered Zeena's sarcastic stare when Mattie, on the evening of her arrival, had come down to supper with smoothed hair and a ribbon at her neck. ", "He passed by the graves on the knoll and turned his head to glance at one of the older headstones, which had interested him deeply as a boy because it bore his name.

", "He stood in the darkness expecting to hear her step. ", "It did not come, and after vainly straining his ears he called out in a voice that shook with joy: ", "\"Hello, Matt!\" ", "Silence answered; ", "but in a minute or two he caught a sound on the stairs and saw a line of light about the door-frame, as he had seen it the night before. ", "So strange was the precision with which the incidents of the previous evening were repeating themselves that he half expected, when he heard the key turn, to see his wife before him on the threshold; ", "but the door opened, and Mattie faced him. ", "She stood just as Zeena had stood, a lifted lamp in her hand, against the black background of the kitchen. ", "She held the light at the same level, and it drew out with the same distinctness her slim young throat and the brown wrist no bigger than a child's. ", "Then, striking upward, it threw a lustrous fleck on her lips, edged her eyes with velvet shade, and laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her brows. ", "She wore her usual dress of darkish stuff, and there was no bow at her neck; ", "but through her hair she had run a streak of crimson ribbon. ", "This tribute to the unusual transformed and glorified her. ", "She seemed to Ethan taller, fuller, more womanly in shape and motion. ", "She stood aside, smiling silently, while he entered, and then moved away from him with something soft and flowing in her gait. ", "She set the lamp on the table, and he saw that it was carefully laid for supper, with fresh dough-nuts, stewed blueberries and his favourite pickles in a dish of gay red glass.

", "He went out into the passage to hang up his coat and pull off his wet boots. ", "When he came back Mattie had set the teapot on the table and the cat was rubbing itself persuasively against her ankles. ", "\"Why, Puss!

", "Her eyes danced with malice. ", "Why, Jotham Powell. ", "He came in after he got back, and asked for a drop of coffee before he went down home. ", "The blackness lifted and light flooded Ethan's brain. ", "That all? ", "Well, I hope you made out to let him have it.\" ", "And after a pause he felt it right to add: ", "I suppose he got Zeena over to the Flats all right?\" ", "\"Oh, yes; ", "in plenty of time. ", "\" The name threw a chill between them, and they stood a moment looking sideways at each other before Mattie said with a shy laugh. ", "\" I guess it's about time for supper. ", "\" They drew their seats up to the table, and the cat, unbidden, jumped between them into Zeena's empty chair. ", "\" Oh, Puss!\" said Mattie, and they laughed again. ", "Ethan, a moment earlier, had felt himself on the brink of eloquence; ", "but the mention of Zeena had paralysed him. ", "Mattie seemed to feel the contagion of his embarrassment, and sat with downcast lids, sipping her tea, while he feigned an insatiable appetite for dough-nuts and sweet pickles. ", "At last, after casting about for an effective opening, he took a long gulp of tea, cleared his throat, and said: ", "\"Looks as if there'd be more snow.\" ", "She feigned great interest. \" ", "Is that so?

", "Mattie, in an instant, had sprung from her chair and was down on her knees by the fragments. ", "\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan-it's all to pieces! ", "What will Zeena say? ", "But this time his courage was up. \" ", "Well, she'll have to say it to the cat, any way!\" ", "he rejoined with a laugh, kneeling down at Mattie's side to scrape up the swimming pickles. ", "She lifted stricken eyes to him. \" ", "Yes, but, you see, she never meant it should be used, not even when there was company; ", "and I had to get up on the step-ladder to reach it down from the top shelf of the china-closet, where she keeps it with all her best things, and of course she'll want to know why I did it-\"   ", "The case was so serious that it called forth all of Ethan's latent resolution. ", "\"She needn't know anything about it if you keep quiet. ", "I'll get another just like it to-morrow. ", "Where did it come from? ", "I'll go to Shadd's Falls for it if I have to!\" ", "\"Oh, you'll never get another even there! ", "It was a wedding present-don't you remember? ", "It came all the way from Philadelphia, from Zeena's aunt that married the minister. ", "That's why she wouldn't ever use it. ", "Oh, Ethan, Ethan, what in the world shall I do?\" ", "She began to cry, and he felt as if every one of her tears were pouring over him like burning lead. ", "\" Don't, Matt, don't-oh, don't!\" ", "he implored her. ", "She struggled to her feet, and he rose and followed her helplessly while she spread out the pieces of glass on the kitchen dresser.

", "She drew aside, instinctively obeying his tone. ", "\" Oh, Ethan, what are you going to do?\" ", "Without replying he gathered the pieces of glass into his broad palm and walked out of the kitchen to the passage. ", "There he lit a candle-end, opened the china-closet, and, reaching his long arm up to the highest shelf, laid the pieces together with such accuracy of touch that a close inspection convinced him of the impossibility of detecting from below that the dish was broken. ", "If he glued it together the next morning months might elapse before his wife noticed what had happened, and meanwhile he might after all be able to match the dish at Shadd's Falls or Bettsbridge. ", "Having satisfied himself that there was no risk of immediate discovery he went back to the kitchen with a lighter step, and found Mattie disconsolately removing the last scraps of pickle from the floor. ", "\"It's all right, Matt. ", "Come back and finish supper,\" he commanded her. ", "Completely reassured, she shone on him through tear-hung lashes, and his soul swelled with pride as he saw how his tone subdued her. ", "She did not even ask what he had done. ", "Except when he was steering a big log down the mountain to his mill he had never known such a thrilling sense of mastery. ", "V   They finished supper, and while Mattie cleared the table Ethan went to look at the cows and then took a last turn about the house. ", "The earth lay dark under a muffled sky and the air was so still that now and then he heard a lump of snow come thumping down from a tree far off on the edge of the wood-lot. ", "When he returned to the kitchen Mattie had pushed up his chair to the stove and seated herself near the lamp with a bit of sewing. ", "The scene was just as he had dreamed of it that morning. ", "He sat down, drew his pipe from his pocket and stretched his feet to the glow. ", "His hard day's work in the keen air made him feel at once lazy and light of mood, and he had a confused sense of being in another world, where all was warmth and harmony and time could bring no change. ", "The only drawback to his complete well-being was the fact that he could not see Mattie from where he sat; ", "but he was too indolent to move and after a moment he said: ", "\"Come over here and sit by the stove.\" ", "Zeena's empty rocking-chair stood facing him. ", "Mattie rose obediently, and seated herself in it. ", "As her young brown head detached itself against the patch-work cushion that habitually framed his wife's gaunt countenance, Ethan had a momentary shock. ", "It was almost as if the other face, the face of the superseded woman, had obliterated that of the intruder. ", "After a moment Mattie seemed to be affected by the same sense of constraint. ", "She changed her position, leaning forward to bend her head above her work, so that he saw only the foreshortened tip of her nose and the streak of red in her hair; ", "then she slipped to her feet, saying \"I can't see to sew,\" and went back to her chair by the lamp. ", "Ethan made a pretext of getting up to replenish the stove, and when he returned to his seat he pushed it sideways that he might get a view of her profile and of the lamplight falling on her hands. ", "The cat, who had been a puzzled observer of these unusual movements, jumped up into Zeena's chair, rolled itself into a ball, and lay watching them with narrowed eyes. ", "Deep quiet sank on the room. ", "The clock ticked above the dresser, a piece of charred wood fell now and then in the stove, and the faint sharp scent of the geraniums mingled with the odour of Ethan's smoke, which began to throw a blue haze about the lamp and to hang its greyish cobwebs in the shadowy corners of the room. ", "All constraint had vanished between the two, and they began to talk easily and simply. ", "They spoke of every-day things, of the prospect of snow, of the next church sociable, of the loves and quarrels of Starkfield. ", "The commonplace nature of what they said produced in Ethan an illusion of long-established intimacy which no outburst of emotion could have given, and he set his imagination adrift on the fiction that they had always spent their evenings thus and would always go on doing so... ", "\"This is the night we were to have gone coasting, Matt,\" he said at length, with the rich sense, as he spoke, that they could go on any other night they chose, since they had all time before them. ", "She smiled back at him. ", "\" I guess you forgot!\" ", "\"No, I didn't forget; ", "but it's as dark as Egypt outdoors. ", "We might go to-morrow if there's a moon.\" ", "She laughed with pleasure, her head tilted back, the lamplight sparkling on her lips and teeth. ", "\" That would be lovely, Ethan!\" ", "He kept his eyes fixed on her, marvelling at the way her face changed with each turn of their talk, like a wheat-field under a summer breeze. ", "It was intoxicating to find such magic in his clumsy words, and he longed to try new ways of using it. \" ", "Would you be scared to go down the Corbury road with me on a night like this?\" he asked. ", "Her cheeks burned redder. ", "\" I ain't any more scared than you are!\" ", "\"Well, I'd be scared, then; ", "I wouldn't do it. ", "That's an ugly corner down by the big elm. ", "If a fellow didn't keep his eyes open he'd go plumb into it.\" ", "He luxuriated in the sense of protection and authority which his words conveyed. ", "To prolong and intensify the feeling he added: ", "\"I guess we're well enough here. ", "She let her lids sink slowly, in the way he loved. ", "\" Yes, we're well enough here,\" she sighed. ", "Her tone was so sweet that he took the pipe from his mouth and drew his chair up to the table. ", "Leaning forward, he touched the farther end of the strip of brown stuff that she was hemming. ", "\" Say, Matt,\" he began with a smile, \"what do you think I saw under the Varnum spruces, coming along home just now? ", "I saw a friend of yours getting kissed. ", "\" The words had been on his tongue all the evening, but now that he had spoken them they struck him as inexpressibly vulgar and out of place. ", "Mattie blushed to the roots of her hair and pulled her needle rapidly twice or thrice through her work, insensibly drawing the end of it away from him. ", "\" I suppose it was Ruth and Ned,\" she said in a low voice, as though he had suddenly touched on something grave. ", "Ethan had imagined that his allusion might open the way to the accepted pleasantries, and these perhaps in turn to a harmless caress, if only a mere touch on her hand. ", "But now he felt as if her blush had set a flaming guard about her. ", "He supposed it was his natural awkwardness that made him feel so. ", "He knew that most young men made nothing at all of giving a pretty girl a kiss, and he remembered that the night before, when he had put his arm about Mattie, she had not resisted. ", "But that had been out-of-doors, under the open irresponsible night. ", "Now, in the warm lamplit room, with all its ancient implications of conformity and order, she seemed infinitely farther away from him and more unapproachable. ", "To ease his constraint he said: ", "I suppose they'll be setting a date before long.\" ", "\"Yes. ", "I shouldn't wonder if they got married some time along in the summer. ", "\" She pronounced the word married as if her voice caressed it. ", "It seemed a rustling covert leading to enchanted glades. ", "A pang shot through Ethan, and he said, twisting away from her in his chair: ", "It'll be your turn next, I wouldn't wonder. ", "\" She laughed a little uncertainly. ", "\" Why do you keep on saying that?\" ", "He echoed her laugh. ", "\" I guess I do it to get used to the idea.\" ", "He drew up to the table again and she sewed on in silence, with dropped lashes, while he sat in fascinated contemplation of the way in which her hands went up and down above the strip of stuff, just as he had seen a pair of birds make short perpendicular flights over a nest they were building. ", "At length, without turning her head or lifting her lids, she said in a low tone: ", "It's not because you think Zeena's got anything against me, is it?\" ", "His former dread started up full-armed at the suggestion. ", "\" Why, what do you mean?\" he stammered. ", "She raised distressed eyes to his, her work dropping on the table between them. ", "\" I don't know. ", "I thought last night she seemed to have.\" ", "\"I'd like to know what,\" he growled. ", "\"Nobody can tell with Zeena. ", "\" It was the first time they had ever spoken so openly of her attitude toward Mattie, and the repetition of the name seemed to carry it to the farther corners of the room and send it back to them in long repercussions of sound. ", "Mattie waited, as if to give the echo time to drop, and then went on: ", "She hasn't said anything to you?\" ", "He shook his head. ", "No, not a word. ", "\" She tossed the hair back from her forehead with a laugh. ", "\" I guess I'm just nervous, then. ", "I'm not going to think about it any more.\" ", "\"Oh, no-don't let's think about it, Matt!\" ", "The sudden heat of his tone made her colour mount again, not with a rush, but gradually, delicately, like the reflection of a thought stealing slowly across her heart. ", "She sat silent, her hands clasped on her work, and it seemed to him that a warm current flowed toward him along the strip of stuff that still lay unrolled between them. ", "Cautiously he slid his hand palm-downward along the table till his finger-tips touched the end of the stuff. ", "A faint vibration of her lashes seemed to show that she was aware of his gesture, and that it had sent a counter-current back to her; ", "and she let her hands lie motionless on the other end of the strip. ", "As they sat thus he heard a sound behind him and turned his head. ", "The cat had jumped from Zeena's chair to dart at a mouse in the wainscot, and as a result of the sudden movement the empty chair had set up a spectral rocking. ", "\"She'll be rocking in it herself this time to-morrow,\" Ethan thought. ", "\"I've been in a dream, and this is the only evening we'll ever have together. ", "\" The return to reality was as painful as the return to consciousness after taking an anaesthetic. ", "His body and brain ached with indescribable weariness, and he could think of nothing to say or to do that should arrest the mad flight of the moments. ", "His alteration of mood seemed to have communicated itself to Mattie. ", "She looked up at him languidly, as though her lids were weighted with sleep and it cost her an effort to raise them. ", "Her glance fell on his hand, which now completely covered the end of her work and grasped it as if it were a part of herself. ", "He saw a scarcely perceptible tremor cross her face, and without knowing what he did he stooped his head and kissed the bit of stuff in his hold. ", "As his lips rested on it he felt it glide slowly from beneath them, and saw that Mattie had risen and was silently rolling up her work. ", "She fastened it with a pin, and then, finding her thimble and scissors, put them with the roll of stuff into the box covered with fancy paper which he had once brought to her from Bettsbridge. ", "He stood up also, looking vaguely about the room. ", "The clock above the dresser struck eleven. \" ", "Is the fire all right?\" ", "she asked in a low voice. ", "He opened the door of the stove and poked aimlessly at the embers. ", "When he raised himself again he saw that she was dragging toward the stove the old soap-box lined with carpet in which the cat made its bed. ", "Then she recrossed the floor and lifted two of the geranium pots in her arms, moving them away from the cold window. ", "He followed her and brought the other geraniums, the hyacinth bulbs in a cracked custard bowl and the German ivy trained over an old croquet hoop. ", "When these nightly duties were performed there was nothing left to do but to bring in the tin candlestick from the passage, light the candle and blow out the lamp. ", "Ethan put the candlestick in Mattie's hand and she went out of the kitchen ahead of him, the light that she carried before her making her dark hair look like a drift of mist on the moon. ", "\"Good night, Matt,\" he said as she put her foot on the first step of the stairs. ", "She turned and looked at him a moment. ", "\" Good night, Ethan,\" she answered, and went up. ", "When the door of her room had closed on her he remembered that he had not even touched her hand. ", "VI    ", "The next morning at breakfast Jotham Powell was between them, and Ethan tried to hide his joy under an air of exaggerated indifference, lounging back in his chair to throw scraps to the cat, growling at the weather, and not so much as offering to help Mattie when she rose to clear away the dishes. ", "He did not know why he was so irrationally happy, for nothing was changed in his life or hers. ", "He had not even touched the tip of her fingers or looked her full in the eyes. ", "But their evening together had given him a vision of what life at her side might be, and he was glad now that he had done nothing to trouble the sweetness of the picture. ", "He had a fancy that she knew what had restrained him... ", "There was a last load of lumber to be hauled to the village, and Jotham Powell-who did not work regularly for Ethan in winter-had \"come round\"  to help with the job. ", "But a wet snow, melting to sleet, had fallen in the night and turned the roads to glass. ", "There was more wet in the air and it seemed likely to both men that the weather would \"milden\" toward afternoon and make the going safer. ", "Ethan therefore proposed to his assistant that they should load the sledge at the wood-lot, as they had done on the previous morning, and put off the \"teaming\" to Starkfield till later in the day. ", "This plan had the advantage of enabling him to send Jotham to the Flats after dinner to meet Zenobia, while he himself took the lumber down to the village. ", "He told Jotham to go out and harness up the greys, and for a moment he and Mattie had the kitchen to themselves. ", "She had plunged the breakfast dishes into a tin dish-pan and was bending above it with her slim arms bared to the elbow, the steam from the hot water beading her forehead and tightening her rough hair into little brown rings like the tendrils on the traveller's joy. ", "Ethan stood looking at her, his heart in his throat. ", "He wanted to say: ", "We shall never be alone again like this.\" ", "Instead, he reached down his tobacco-pouch from a shelf of the dresser, put it into his pocket and said: ", "\"I guess I can make out to be home for dinner. ", "\" She answered \"All right, Ethan,\" and he heard her singing over the dishes as he went. ", "As soon as the sledge was loaded he meant to send Jotham back to the farm and hurry on foot into the village to buy the glue for the pickle-dish. ", "With ordinary luck he should have had time to carry out this plan; ", "but everything went wrong from the start. ", "On the way over to the wood-lot one of the greys slipped on a glare of ice and cut his knee; ", "and when they got him up again Jotham had to go back to the barn for a strip of rag to bind the cut. ", "Then, when the loading finally began, a sleety rain was coming down once more, and the tree trunks were so slippery that it took twice as long as usual to lift them and get them in place on the sledge. ", "It was what Jotham called a sour morning for work, and the horses, shivering and stamping under their wet blankets, seemed to like it as little as the men. ", "It was long past the dinner-hour when the job was done, and Ethan had to give up going to the village because he wanted to lead the injured horse home and wash the cut himself. ", "He thought that by starting out again with the lumber as soon as he had finished his dinner he might get back to the farm with the glue before Jotham and the old sorrel had had time to fetch Zenobia from the Flats; ", "but he knew the chance was a slight one. ", "It turned on the state of the roads and on the possible lateness of the Bettsbridge train. ", "He remembered afterward, with a grim flash of self-derision, what importance he had attached to the weighing of these probabilities... ", "As soon as dinner was over he set out again for the wood-lot, not daring to linger till Jotham Powell left. ", "The hired man was still drying his wet feet at the stove, and Ethan could only give Mattie a quick look as he said beneath his breath: ", "\"I'll be back early.\" ", "He fancied that she nodded her comprehension; ", "and with that scant solace he had to trudge off through the rain. ", "He had driven his load half-way to the village when Jotham Powell overtook him, urging the reluctant sorrel toward the Flats. ", "\" I'll have to hurry up to do it,\" Ethan mused, as the sleigh dropped down ahead of him over the dip of the school-house hill. ", "He worked like ten at the unloading, and when it was over hastened on to Michael Eady's for the glue. ", "Eady and his assistant were both \"down street,\" and young Denis, who seldom deigned to take their place, was lounging by the stove with a knot of the golden youth of Starkfield. ", "They hailed Ethan with ironic compliment and offers of conviviality; ", "but no one knew where to find the glue. ", "Ethan, consumed with the longing for a last moment alone with Mattie, hung about impatiently while Denis made an ineffectual search in the obscurer corners of the store. \" ", "Looks as if we were all sold out. ", "But if you'll wait around till the old man comes along maybe he can put his hand on it.\" ", "\"I'm obliged to you, but I'll try if I can get it down at Mrs. Homan's,\"   ", "Ethan answered, burning to be gone. ", "Denis's commercial instinct compelled him to aver on oath that what Eady's store could not produce would never be found at the widow Homan's; ", "but Ethan, heedless of this boast, had already climbed to the sledge and was driving on to the rival establishment. ", "Here, after considerable search, and sympathetic questions as to what he wanted it for, and whether ordinary flour paste wouldn't do as well if she couldn't find it, the widow Homan finally hunted down her solitary bottle of glue to its hiding-place in a medley of cough-lozenges and corset-laces. ", "\"I hope Zeena ain't broken anything she sets store by,\" she called after him as he turned the greys toward home. ", "The fitful bursts of sleet had changed into a steady rain and the horses had heavy work even without a load behind them. ", "Once or twice, hearing sleigh-bells, Ethan turned his head, fancying that Zeena and Jotham might overtake him; ", "but the old sorrel was not in sight, and he set his face against the rain and urged on his ponderous pair. ", "The barn was empty when the horses turned into it and, after giving them the most perfunctory ministrations they had ever received from him, he strode up to the house and pushed open the kitchen door. ", "Mattie was there alone, as he had pictured her. ", "She was bending over a pan on the stove; ", "but at the sound of his step she turned with a start and sprang to him. ", "\"See, here, Matt, I've got some stuff to mend the dish with! ", "Let me get at it quick,\" he cried, waving the bottle in one hand while he put her lightly aside; ", "but she did not seem to hear him. \" ", "Oh, Ethan-Zeena's come,\" she said in a whisper, clutching his sleeve. ", "They stood and stared at each other, pale as culprits. \" ", "But the sorrel's not in the barn!\" ", "Ethan stammered. \" ", "Jotham Powell brought some goods over from the Flats for his wife, and he drove right on home with them,\" she explained. ", "He gazed blankly about the kitchen, which looked cold and squalid in the rainy winter twilight. ", "\"How is she?\" ", "he asked, dropping his voice to Mattie's whisper. ", "She looked away from him uncertainly. ", "\" I don't know. ", "She went right up to her room.\" ", "\"She didn't say anything?\" ", "\"No.\" ", "Ethan let out his doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back into his pocket. \" ", "Don't fret; ", "I'll come down and mend it in the night,\"  he said. ", "He pulled on his wet coat again and went back to the barn to feed the greys. ", "While he was there Jotham Powell drove up with the sleigh, and when the horses had been attended to Ethan said to him: ", "\"You might as well come back up for a bite. ", "He was not sorry to assure himself of Jotham's neutralising presence at the supper table, for Zeena was always \"nervous\" after a journey. ", "But the hired man, though seldom loth to accept a meal not included in his wages, opened his stiff jaws to answer slowly: ", "I'm obliged to you, but I guess I'll go along back. ", "\" Ethan looked at him in surprise. \" ", "Better come up and dry off. ", "Looks as if there'd be something hot for supper.\" ", "Jotham's facial muscles were unmoved by this appeal and, his vocabulary being limited, he merely repeated: ", "\"I guess I'll go along back.\" ", "To Ethan there was something vaguely ominous in this stolid rejection of free food and warmth, and he wondered what had happened on the drive to nerve Jotham to such stoicism. ", "Perhaps Zeena had failed to see the new doctor or had not liked his counsels: ", "Ethan knew that in such cases the first person she met was likely to be held responsible for her grievance. ", "When he re-entered the kitchen the lamp lit up the same scene of shining comfort as on the previous evening. ", "The table had been as carefully laid, a clear fire glowed in the stove, the cat dozed in its warmth, and Mattie came forward carrying a plate of dough-nuts.

", "\" It was the consecrated formula, and he expected it to be followed, as usual, by her rising and going down to supper. ", "But she remained seated, and he could think of nothing more felicitous than: ", "\"I presume you're tired after the long ride. ", "\" Turning her head at this, she answered solemnly: ", "I'm a great deal sicker than you think. ", "\" Her words fell on his ear with a strange shock of wonder. ", "He had often heard her pronounce them before-what if at last they were true? ", "He advanced a step or two into the dim room. ", "\" I hope that's not so, Zeena,\" he said. ", "She continued to gaze at him through the twilight with a mien of wan authority, as of one consciously singled out for a great fate. ", "\" I've got complications,\" she said. ", "Ethan knew the word for one of exceptional import. ", "Almost everybody in the neighbourhood had \"troubles,\" frankly localized and specified; ", "but only the chosen had \"complications.\" ", "To have them was in itself a distinction, though it was also, in most cases, a death-warrant. ", "People struggled on for years with \"troubles,\" but they almost always succumbed to \"complications.\" ", "Ethan's heart was jerking to and fro between two extremities of feeling, but for the moment compassion prevailed. ", "His wife looked so hard and lonely, sitting there in the darkness with such thoughts. \" ", "Is that what the new doctor told you?\" ", "he asked, instinctively lowering his voice. ", "Yes. ", "He says any regular doctor would want me to have an operation. ", "\" Ethan was aware that, in regard to the important question of surgical intervention, the female opinion of the neighbourhood was divided, some glorying in the prestige conferred by operations while others shunned them as indelicate. ", "Ethan, from motives of economy, had always been glad that Zeena was of the latter faction. ", "In the agitation caused by the gravity of her announcement he sought a consolatory short cut. ", "\" What do you know about this doctor anyway? ", "Nobody ever told you that before.\" ", "He saw his blunder before she could take it up: ", "she wanted sympathy, not consolation. ", "\"I didn't need to have anybody tell me I was losing ground every day. ", "Everybody but you could see it. ", "And everybody in Bettsbridge knows about Dr. Buck. ", "He has his office in Worcester, and comes over once a fortnight to Shadd's Falls and Bettsbridge for consultations. ", "Eliza Spears was wasting away with kidney trouble before she went to him, and now she's up and around, and singing in the choir.\" ", "\"Well, I'm glad of that. ", "You must do just what he tells you,\" Ethan answered sympathetically. ", "She was still looking at him. ", "\" I mean to,\" she said. ", "He was struck by a new note in her voice. ", "It was neither whining nor reproachful, but drily resolute. ", "\"What does he want you should do?\" he asked, with a mounting vision of fresh expenses. \" ", "He wants I should have a hired girl. ", "He says I oughtn't to have to do a single thing around the house.\" ", "\"A hired girl?\" ", "Ethan stood transfixed. ", "Yes. ", "And Aunt Martha found me one right off. ", "Everybody said I was lucky to get a girl to come away out here, and I agreed to give her a dollar extry to make sure. ", "She'll be over to-morrow afternoon. ", "\" Wrath and dismay contended in Ethan. ", "He had foreseen an immediate demand for money, but not a permanent drain on his scant resources. ", "He no longer believed what Zeena had told him of the supposed seriousness of her state: ", "he saw in her expedition to Bettsbridge only a plot hatched between herself and her Pierce relations to foist on him the cost of a servant; ", "and for the moment wrath predominated. ", "\"If you meant to engage a girl you ought to have told me before you started,\" he said. ", "\"How could I tell you before I started? ", "How did I know what Dr. Buck would say?\" ", "\"Oh, Dr. Buck-\" Ethan's incredulity escaped in a short laugh. \" ", "Did Dr. Buck tell you how I was to pay her wages?\" ", "Her voice rose furiously with his. \" ", "No, he didn't. ", "For I'd 'a' been ashamed to tell him that you grudged me the money to get back my health, when I lost it nursing your own mother!\" ", "\"You lost your health nursing mother?\" ", "\"Yes; ", "and my folks all told me at the time you couldn't do no less than marry me after-\"  \"Zeena!\" ", "Through the obscurity which hid their faces their thoughts seemed to dart at each other like serpents shooting venom. ", "Ethan was seized with horror of the scene and shame at his own share in it. ", "It was as senseless and savage as a physical fight between two enemies in the darkness. ", "He turned to the shelf above the chimney, groped for matches and lit the one candle in the room. ", "At first its weak flame made no impression on the shadows; ", "then Zeena's face stood grimly out against the uncurtained pane, which had turned from grey to black. ", "It was the first scene of open anger between the couple in their sad seven years together, and Ethan felt as if he had lost an irretrievable advantage in descending to the level of recrimination.

", "There's a whole lot more I can do for you, and Mattie-\"  Zeena, while he spoke, seemed to be following out some elaborate mental calculation.

", "\" I knew the cat was a smart cat,\" she said in a high voice, \"but I didn't know he was smart enough to pick up the pieces of my pickle-dish and lay 'em edge to edge on the very shelf he knocked 'em off of. ", "Mattie suddenly drew her arms out of the steaming water. ", "\" It wasn't Ethan's fault, Zeena! ", "The cat did break the dish; ", "but I got it down from the china-closet, and I'm the one to blame for its getting broken.\" ", "Zeena stood beside the ruin of her treasure, stiffening into a stony image of resentment, \"You got down my pickle-dish-what for?\" ", "A bright flush flew to Mattie's cheeks. ", "\" I wanted to make the supper-table pretty,\" she said. ", "\"You wanted to make the supper-table pretty; ", "and you waited till my back was turned, and took the thing I set most store by of anything I've got, and wouldn't never use it, not even when the minister come to dinner, or Aunt Martha Pierce come over from Bettsbridge-\" ", "Zeena paused with a gasp, as if terrified by her own evocation of the sacrilege.

", "He still took refuge there in summer, but when Mattie came to live at the farm he had to give her his stove, and consequently the room was uninhabitable for several months of the year. ", "To this retreat he descended as soon as the house was quiet, and Zeena's steady breathing from the bed had assured him that there was to be no sequel to the scene in the kitchen. ", "After Zeena's departure he and Mattie had stood speechless, neither seeking to approach the other. ", "Then the girl had returned to her task of clearing up the kitchen for the night and he had taken his lantern and gone on his usual round outside the house. ", "The kitchen was empty when he came back to it; ", "but his tobacco-pouch and pipe had been laid on the table, and under them was a scrap of paper torn from the back of a seedsman's catalogue, on which three words were written: ", "\"Don't trouble, Ethan. ", "\" Going into his cold dark \"study\" he placed the lantern on the table and, stooping to its light, read the message again and again. ", "It was the first time that Mattie had ever written to him, and the possession of the paper gave him a strange new sense of her nearness; ", "yet it deepened his anguish by reminding him that henceforth they would have no other way of communicating with each other. ", "For the life of her smile, the warmth of her voice, only cold paper and dead words! ", "Confused motions of rebellion stormed in him. ", "He was too young, too strong, too full of the sap of living, to submit so easily to the destruction of his hopes. ", "Must he wear out all his years at the side of a bitter querulous woman? ", "Other possibilities had been in him, possibilities sacrificed, one by one, to Zeena's narrow-mindedness and ignorance. ", "And what good had come of it? ", "She was a hundred times bitterer and more discontented than when he had married her: ", "the one pleasure left her was to inflict pain on him. ", "All the healthy instincts of self-defence rose up in him against such waste... ", "He bundled himself into his old coon-skin coat and lay down on the box-sofa to think. ", "Under his cheek he felt a hard object with strange protuberances. ", "It was a cushion which Zeena had made for him when they were engaged-the only piece of needlework he had ever seen her do. ", "He flung it across the floor and propped his head against the wall... ", "He knew a case of a man over the mountain-a young fellow of about his own age-who had escaped from just such a life of misery by going West with the girl he cared for. ", "His wife had divorced him, and he had married the girl and prospered. ", "Ethan had seen the couple the summer before at Shadd's Falls, where they had come to visit relatives. ", "They had a little girl with fair curls, who wore a gold locket and was dressed like a princess. ", "The deserted wife had not done badly either. ", "Her husband had given her the farm and she had managed to sell it, and with that and the alimony she had started a lunch-room at Bettsbridge and bloomed into activity and importance. ", "Ethan was fired by the thought. ", "Why should he not leave with Mattie the next day, instead of letting her go alone? ", "He would hide his valise under the seat of the sleigh, and Zeena would suspect nothing till she went upstairs for her afternoon nap and found a letter on the bed... ", "His impulses were still near the surface, and he sprang up, re-lit the lantern, and sat down at the table. ", "He rummaged in the drawer for a sheet of paper, found one, and began to write. \" ", "Zeena, I've done all I could for you, and I don't see as it's been any use. ", "I don't blame you, nor I don't blame myself. ", "Maybe both of us will do better separate. ", "I'm going to try my luck West, and you can sell the farm and mill, and keep the money-\"   ", "His pen paused on the word, which brought home to him the relentless conditions of his lot. ", "If he gave the farm and mill to Zeena what would be left him to start his own life with? ", "Once in the West he was sure of picking up work-he would not have feared to try his chance alone. ", "But with Mattie depending on him the case was different. ", "And what of Zeena's fate? ", "Farm and mill were mortgaged to the limit of their value, and even if she found a purchaser-in itself an unlikely chance-it was doubtful if she could clear a thousand dollars on the sale. ", "Meanwhile, how could she keep the farm going? ", "It was only by incessant labour and personal supervision that Ethan drew a meagre living from his land, and ", "his wife, even if she were in better health than she imagined, could never carry such a burden alone. ", "Well, she could go back to her people, then, and see what they would do for her. ", "It was the fate she was forcing on Mattie-why not let her try it herself? ", "By the time she had discovered his whereabouts, and brought suit for divorce, he would probably-wherever he was-be earning enough to pay her a sufficient alimony. ", "And the alternative was to let Mattie go forth alone, with far less hope of ultimate provision... ", "He had scattered the contents of the table-drawer in his search for a sheet of paper, and as he took up his pen his eye fell on an old copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle. ", "The advertising sheet was folded uppermost, and he read the seductive words: ", "\"Trips to the West: ", "Reduced Rates.\" ", "He drew the lantern nearer and eagerly scanned the fares; ", "then the paper fell from his hand and he pushed aside his unfinished letter. ", "A moment ago he had wondered what he and Mattie were to live on when they reached the West; ", "now he saw that he had not even the money to take her there. ", "Borrowing was out of the question: ", "six months before he had given his only security to raise funds for necessary repairs to the mill, and he knew that without security no one at Starkfield would lend him ten dollars. ", "The inexorable facts closed in on him like prison-warders handcuffing a convict. ", "There was no way out-none. ", "He was a prisoner for life, and now his one ray of light was to be extinguished. ", "He crept back heavily to the sofa, stretching himself out with limbs so leaden that he felt as if they would never move again. ", "Tears rose in his throat and slowly burned their way to his lids. ", "As he lay there, the window-pane that faced him, growing gradually lighter, inlaid upon the darkness a square of moon-suffused sky. ", "A crooked tree-branch crossed it, a branch of the apple-tree under which, on summer evenings, he had sometimes found Mattie sitting when he came up from the mill. ", "Slowly the rim of the rainy vapours caught fire and burnt away, and a pure moon swung into the blue. ", "Ethan, rising on his elbow, watched the landscape whiten and shape itself under the sculpture of the moon. ", "This was the night on which he was to have taken Mattie coasting, and there hung the lamp to light them! ", "He looked out at the slopes bathed in lustre, the silver-edged darkness of the woods, the spectral purple of the hills against the sky, and it seemed as though all the beauty of the night had been poured out to mock his wretchedness... ", "He fell asleep, and when he woke the chill of the winter dawn was in the room. ", "He felt cold and stiff and hungry, and ashamed of being hungry. ", "He rubbed his eyes and went to the window. ", "A red sun stood over the grey rim of the fields, behind trees that looked black and brittle. ", "He said to himself: ", "This is Matt's last day,\" and tried to think what the place would be without her. ", "As he stood there he heard a step behind him and she entered. ", "\"Oh, Ethan-were you here all night?\" ", "She looked so small and pinched, in her poor dress, with the red scarf wound about her, and the cold light turning her paleness sallow, that Ethan stood before her without speaking. ", "\"You must be frozen,\" she went on, fixing lustreless eyes on him. ", "He drew a step nearer. ", "\" How did you know I was here?\" ", "\"Because I heard you go down stairs again after I went to bed, and I listened all night, and you didn't come up. ", "\" All his tenderness rushed to his lips. ", "He looked at her and said: ", "\"I'll come right along and make up the kitchen fire. ", "\" They went back to the kitchen, and he fetched the coal and kindlings and cleared out the stove for her, while she brought in the milk and the cold remains of the meat-pie. ", "When warmth began to radiate from the stove, and the first ray of sunlight lay on the kitchen floor, Ethan's dark thoughts melted in the mellower air. ", "The sight of Mattie going about her work as he had seen her on so many mornings made it seem impossible that she should ever cease to be a part of the scene. ", "He said to himself that he had doubtless exaggerated the significance of Zeena's threats, and that she too, with the return of daylight, would come to a saner mood. ", "He went up to Mattie as she bent above the stove, and laid his hand on her arm. ", "\" I don't want you should trouble either,\" he said, looking down into her eyes with a smile. ", "She flushed up warmly and whispered back: ", "No, Ethan, I ain't going to trouble.\" ", "\"I guess things'll straighten out,\" he added. ", "There was no answer but a quick throb of her lids, and he went on: ", "\"She ain't said anything this morning?\" ", "\"No. ", "I haven't seen her yet.\" ", "\"Don't you take any notice when you do. ", "With this injunction he left her and went out to the cow-barn. ", "He saw Jotham Powell walking up the hill through the morning mist, and the familiar sight added to his growing conviction of security. ", "As the two men were clearing out the stalls Jotham rested on his pitch-fork to say: ", "Dan'l Byrne's goin' over to the Flats to-day noon, an' he c'd take Mattie's trunk along, and make it easier ridin' when I take her over in the sleigh. ", "\" Ethan looked at him blankly, and he continued: ", "\"Mis' Frome said the new girl'd be at the Flats at five, and I was to take Mattie then, so's 't she could ketch the six o'clock train for Stamford.

", "He had to wait a moment before he could find voice to say: ", "Oh, it ain't so sure about Mattie's going-\"   ", "\"That so?\" said Jotham indifferently; ", "and they went on with their work. ", "When they returned to the kitchen the two women were already at breakfast. ", "Zeena had an air of unusual alertness and activity. ", "She drank two cups of coffee and fed the cat with the scraps left in the pie-dish; ", "then she rose from her seat and, walking over to the window, snipped two or three yellow leaves from the geraniums. ", "Aunt Martha's ain't got a faded leaf on 'em; ", "but they pine away when they ain't cared for,\" she said reflectively. ", "Then she turned to Jotham and asked: ", "What time'd you say Dan'l Byrne'd be along?\" ", "The hired man threw a hesitating glance at Ethan. ", "Round about noon,\" he said. ", "Zeena turned to Mattie. ", "\" That trunk of yours is too heavy for the sleigh, and Dan'l Byrne'll be round to take it over to the Flats,\" she said. ", "\"I'm much obliged to you, Zeena,\" said Mattie. ", "\"I'd like to go over things with you first,\" Zeena continued in an unperturbed voice. ", "\" I know there's a huckabuck towel missing; ", "and I can't make out what you done with that match-safe 't used to stand behind the stuffed owl in the parlour.\" ", "She went out, followed by Mattie, and when the men were alone Jotham said to his employer: ", "\"I guess I better let Dan'l come round, then.\" ", "Ethan finished his usual morning tasks about the house and barn; ", "then he said to Jotham: ", "I'm going down to Starkfield. ", "Tell them not to wait dinner. ", "\" The passion of rebellion had broken out in him again. ", "That which had seemed incredible in the sober light of day had really come to pass, and he was to assist as a helpless spectator at Mattie's banishment. ", "His manhood was humbled by the part he was compelled to play and by the thought of what Mattie must think of him. ", "Confused impulses struggled in him as he strode along to the village. ", "He had made up his mind to do something, but he did not know what it would be. ", "The early mist had vanished and the fields lay like a silver shield under the sun. ", "It was one of the days when the glitter of winter shines through a pale haze of spring. ", "Every yard of the road was alive with Mattie's presence, and there was hardly a branch against the sky or a tangle of brambles on the bank in which some bright shred of memory was not caught. ", "Once, in the stillness, the call of a bird in a mountain ash was so like her laughter that his heart tightened and then grew large; ", "and all these things made him see that something must be done at once. ", "Suddenly it occurred to him that Andrew Hale, who was a kind-hearted man, might be induced to reconsider his refusal and advance a small sum on the lumber if he were told that Zeena's ill-health made it necessary to hire a servant. ", "Hale, after all, knew enough of Ethan's situation to make it possible for the latter to renew his appeal without too much loss of pride; ", "and, moreover, how much did pride count in the ebullition of passions in his breast? ", "The more he considered his plan the more hopeful it seemed. ", "If he could get Mrs. Hale's ear he felt certain of success, and with fifty dollars in his pocket nothing could keep him from Mattie... ", "His first object was to reach Starkfield before Hale had started for his work; ", "he knew the carpenter had a job down the Corbury road and was likely to leave his house early. ", "Ethan's long strides grew more rapid with the accelerated beat of his thoughts, and as he reached the foot of School House Hill he caught sight of Hale's sleigh in the distance. ", "He hurried forward to meet it, but as it drew nearer he saw that it was driven by the carpenter's youngest boy and that the figure at his side, looking like a large upright cocoon in spectacles, was that of Mrs. Hale. ", "Ethan signed to them to stop, and Mrs. Hale leaned forward, her pink wrinkles twinkling with benevolence. \" ", "Mr. Hale? ", "Why, yes, you'll find him down home now. ", "He ain't going to his work this forenoon. ", "He woke up with a touch o' lumbago, and I just made him put on one of old Dr. Kidder's plasters and set right up into the fire.\" ", "Beaming maternally on Ethan, she bent over to add: ", "\"I on'y just heard from Mr. Hale 'bout Zeena's going over to Bettsbridge to see that new doctor. ", "I'm real sorry she's feeling so bad again! ", "I hope he thinks he can do something for her. ", "I don't know anybody round here's had more sickness than Zeena. ", "I always tell Mr. Hale ", "I don't know what she'd 'a' done if she hadn't 'a' had you to look after her; ", "and I used to say the same thing 'bout your mother. ", "You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome. ", "\" She gave him a last nod of sympathy while her son chirped to the horse; ", "and Ethan, as she drove off, stood in the middle of the road and stared after the retreating sleigh. ", "It was a long time since any one had spoken to him as kindly as Mrs. Hale. ", "Most people were either indifferent to his troubles, or disposed to think it natural that a young fellow of his age should have carried without repining the burden of three crippled lives. ", "But Mrs. Hale had said, \"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome,\" and he felt less alone with his misery. ", "If the Hales were sorry for him they would surely respond to his appeal... ", "He started down the road toward their house, but at the end of a few yards he pulled up sharply, the blood in his face. ", "For the first time, in the light of the words he had just heard, he saw what he was about to do. ", "He was planning to take advantage of the Hales' sympathy to obtain money from them on false pretences. ", "That was a plain statement of the cloudy purpose which had driven him in headlong to Starkfield. ", "With the sudden perception of the point to which his madness had carried him, the madness fell and he saw his life before him as it was. ", "He was a poor man, the husband of a sickly woman, whom his desertion would leave alone and destitute; ", "and even if he had had the heart to desert her he could have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied him. ", "He turned and walked slowly back to the farm. ", "IX    ", "At the kitchen door Daniel Byrne sat in his sleigh behind a big-boned grey who pawed the snow and swung his long head restlessly from side to side. ", "Ethan went into the kitchen and found his wife by the stove. ", "Her head was wrapped in her shawl, and she was reading a book called \"Kidney Troubles and Their Cure\" on which he had had to pay extra postage only a few days before. ", "Zeena did not move or look up when he entered, and after a moment he asked: ", "\"Where's Mattie?\" ", "Without lifting her eyes from the page she replied: ", "\"I presume she's getting down her trunk. ", "\" The blood rushed to his face. ", "Getting down her trunk-alone?\" ", "\"Jotham Powell's down in the wood-lot, and Dan'l Byrne says he darsn't leave that horse,\" she returned. ", "Her husband, without stopping to hear the end of the phrase, had left the kitchen and sprung up the stairs. ", "The door of Mattie's room was shut, and he wavered a moment on the landing. \" ", "Matt,\" he said in a low voice; ", "but there was no answer, and he put his hand on the door-knob. ", "He had never been in her room except once, in the early summer, when he had gone there to plaster up a leak in the eaves, but he remembered exactly how everything had looked: ", "the red-and-white quilt on her narrow bed, the pretty pin-cushion on the chest of drawers, and over it the enlarged photograph of her mother, in an oxydized frame, with a bunch of dyed grasses at the back. ", "Now these and all other tokens of her presence had vanished, and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when Zeena had shown her into it on the day of her arrival. ", "In the middle of the floor stood her trunk, and on the trunk she sat in her Sunday dress, her back turned to the door and her face in her hands. ", "She had not heard Ethan's call because she was sobbing and she did not hear his step till he stood close behind her and laid his hands on her shoulders. ", "Matt-oh, don't-oh, Matt!\" ", "She started up, lifting her wet face to his. \" ", "Ethan-I thought I wasn't ever going to see you again!\" ", "He took her in his arms, pressing her close, and with a trembling hand smoothed away the hair from her forehead. \" ", "Not see me again? ", "What do you mean? ", "She sobbed out: ", "Jotham said you told him we wasn't to wait dinner for you, and I thought-\"   ", "\"You thought I meant to cut it?\" ", "he finished for her grimly. ", "She clung to him without answering, and he laid his lips on her hair, which was soft yet springy, like certain mosses on warm slopes, and had the faint woody fragrance of fresh sawdust in the sun. ", "Through the door they heard Zeena's voice calling out from below: ", "\"Dan'l Byrne says you better hurry up if you want him to take that trunk. ", "\" They drew apart with stricken faces. ", "Words of resistance rushed to Ethan's lips and died there. ", "Mattie found her handkerchief and dried her eyes; ", "then, bending down, she took hold of a handle of the trunk. ", "Ethan put her aside. ", "\" You let go, Matt,\" he ordered her. ", "She answered: ", "It takes two to coax it round the corner\"; ", "and submitting to this argument he grasped the other handle, and together they manoeuvred the heavy trunk out to the landing. ", "\"Now let go,\" he repeated; ", "then he shouldered the trunk and carried it down the stairs and across the passage to the kitchen. ", "Zeena, who had gone back to her seat by the stove, did not lift her head from her book as he passed. ", "Mattie followed him out of the door and helped him to lift the trunk into the back of the sleigh. ", "When it was in place they stood side by side on the door-step, watching Daniel Byrne plunge off behind his fidgety horse. ", "It seemed to Ethan that his heart was bound with cords which an unseen hand was tightening with every tick of the clock. ", "Twice he opened his lips to speak to Mattie and found no breath. ", "At length, as she turned to re-enter the house, he laid a detaining hand on her. ", "\"I'm going to drive you over, Matt,\" he whispered. ", "She murmured back: ", "I think Zeena wants I should go with Jotham. ", "\" \"I'm going to drive you over,\" he repeated; ", "and she went into the kitchen without answering. ", "At dinner Ethan could not eat. ", "If he lifted his eyes they rested on Zeena's pinched face, and the corners of her straight lips seemed to quiver away into a smile. ", "She ate well, declaring that the mild weather made her feel better, and pressed a second helping of beans on Jotham Powell, whose wants she generally ignored. ", "Mattie, when the meal was over, went about her usual task of clearing the table and washing up the dishes. ", "Zeena, after feeding the cat, had returned to her rocking-chair by the stove, and Jotham Powell, who always lingered last, reluctantly pushed back his chair and moved toward the door. ", "On the threshold he turned back to say to Ethan: ", "What time'll I come round for Mattie?\" ", "Ethan was standing near the window, mechanically filling his pipe while he watched Mattie move to and fro. ", "He answered: ", "You needn't come round; ", "I'm going to drive her over myself.\" ", "He saw the rise of the colour in Mattie's averted cheek, and the quick lifting of Zeena's head. ", "\"I want you should stay here this afternoon, Ethan,\" his wife said. ", "\"Jotham can drive Mattie over.\" ", "Mattie flung an imploring glance at him, but he repeated curtly: ", "\"I'm going to drive her over myself.\" ", "Zeena continued in the same even tone: ", "I wanted you should stay and fix up that stove in Mattie's room afore the girl gets here. ", "It ain't been drawing right for nigh on a month now. ", "\" Ethan's voice rose indignantly. ", "\" If it was good enough for Mattie I guess it's good enough for a hired girl.\" ", "\"That girl that's coming told me she was used to a house where they had a furnace,\" Zeena persisted with the same monotonous mildness. ", "\"She'd better ha' stayed there then,\" he flung back at her; ", "and turning to Mattie he added in a hard voice: ", "You be ready by three, Matt; ", "I've got business at Corbury.\" ", "Jotham Powell had started for the barn, and Ethan strode down after him aflame with anger. ", "The pulses in his temples throbbed and a fog was in his eyes. ", "He went about his task without knowing what force directed him, or whose hands and feet were fulfilling its orders. ", "It was not till he led out the sorrel and backed him between the shafts of the sleigh that he once more became conscious of what he was doing. ", "As he passed the bridle over the horse's head, and wound the traces around the shafts, he remembered the day when he had made the same preparations in order to drive over and meet his wife's cousin at the Flats. ", "It was little more than a year ago, on just such a soft afternoon, with a \"feel\" of spring in the air. ", "The sorrel, turning the same big ringed eye on him, nuzzled the palm of his hand in the same way; ", "and one by one all the days between rose up and stood before him... ", "He flung the bearskin into the sleigh, climbed to the seat, and drove up to the house. ", "When he entered the kitchen it was empty, but Mattie's bag and shawl lay ready by the door. ", "He went to the foot of the stairs and listened. ", "No sound reached him from above, but presently he thought he heard some one moving about in his deserted study, and pushing open the door he saw Mattie, in her hat and jacket, standing with her back to him near the table. ", "She started at his approach and turning quickly, said: ", "Is it time?\" ", "\"What are you doing here, Matt?\" ", "he asked her. ", "She looked at him timidly. ", "\" I was just taking a look round-that's all,\"  she answered, with a wavering smile. ", "They went back into the kitchen without speaking, and Ethan picked up her bag and shawl. ", "\"Where's Zeena?\" ", "he asked. ", "\"She went upstairs right after dinner. ", "She said she had those shooting pains again, and didn't want to be disturbed.\" ", "\"Didn't she say good-bye to you?\" ", "\"No. ", "That was all she said. ", "\" Ethan, looking slowly about the kitchen, said to himself with a shudder that in a few hours he would be returning to it alone. ", "Then the sense of unreality overcame him once more, and he could not bring himself to believe that Mattie stood there for the last time before him. ", "\"Come on,\" he said almost gaily, opening the door and putting her bag into the sleigh. ", "He sprang to his seat and bent over to tuck the rug about her as she slipped into the place at his side. ", "Now then, go 'long,\" he said, with a shake of the reins that sent the sorrel placidly jogging down the hill. ", "\"We got lots of time for a good ride, Matt!\" ", "he cried, seeking her hand beneath the fur and pressing it in his. ", "His face tingled and he felt dizzy, as if he had stopped in at the Starkfield saloon on a zero day for a drink. ", "At the gate, instead of making for Starkfield, he turned the sorrel to the right, up the Bettsbridge road. ", "Mattie sat silent, giving no sign of surprise; ", "but after a moment she said: ", "Are you going round by Shadow Pond?\" ", "He laughed and answered: ", "I knew you'd know!\" ", "She drew closer under the bearskin, so that, looking sideways around his coat-sleeve, he could just catch the tip of her nose and a blown brown wave of hair. ", "They drove slowly up the road between fields glistening under the pale sun, and then bent to the right down a lane edged with spruce and larch. ", "Ahead of them, a long way off, a range of hills stained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves against the sky. ", "The lane passed into a pine-wood with boles reddening in the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow. ", "As they entered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the branches with the dropping needles. ", "Here the snow was so pure that the tiny tracks of wood-animals had left on it intricate lace-like patterns, and the bluish cones caught in its surface stood out like ornaments of bronze. ", "Ethan drove on in silence till they reached a part of the wood where the pines were more widely spaced; ", "then he drew up and helped Mattie to get out of the sleigh. ", "They passed between the aromatic trunks, the snow breaking crisply under their feet, till they came to a small sheet of water with steep wooded sides. ", "Across its frozen surface, from the farther bank, a single hill rising against the western sun threw the long conical shadow which gave the lake its name. ", "It was a shy secret spot, full of the same dumb melancholy that Ethan felt in his heart. ", "He looked up and down the little pebbly beach till his eye lit on a fallen tree-trunk half submerged in snow. ", "\"There's where we sat at the picnic,\" he reminded her. ", "The entertainment of which he spoke was one of the few that they had taken part in together: ", "a \"church picnic\" which, on a long afternoon of the preceding summer, had filled the retired place with merry-making. ", "Mattie had begged him to go with her but he had refused. ", "Then, toward sunset, coming down from the mountain where he had been felling timber, he had been caught by some strayed revellers and drawn into the group by the lake, where Mattie, encircled by facetious youths, and bright as a blackberry under her spreading hat, was brewing coffee over a gipsy fire. ", "He remembered the shyness he had felt at approaching her in his uncouth clothes, and then the lighting up of her face, and the way she had broken through the group to come to him with a cup in her hand. ", "They had sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond, and she had missed her gold locket, and set the young men searching for it; ", "and it was Ethan who had spied it in the moss.... ", "That was all; ", "but all their intercourse had been made up of just such inarticulate flashes, when they seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods... ", "\"It was right there I found your locket,\" he said, pushing his foot into a dense tuft of blueberry bushes. ", "\"I never saw anybody with such sharp eyes! ", "\" she answered. ", "She sat down on the tree-trunk in the sun and he sat down beside her. ", "\"You were as pretty as a picture in that pink hat,\" he said. ", "She laughed with pleasure. ", "\" Oh, I guess it was the hat!\" ", "she rejoined. ", "They had never before avowed their inclination so openly, and Ethan, for a moment, had the illusion that he was a free man, wooing the girl he meant to marry. ", "He looked at her hair and longed to touch it again, and to tell her that it smelt of the woods; ", "but he had never learned to say such things. ", "Suddenly she rose to her feet and said: ", "We mustn't stay here any longer.\" ", "He continued to gaze at her vaguely, only half-roused from his dream. ", "\"There's plenty of time,\" he answered. ", "They stood looking at each other as if the eyes of each were straining to absorb and hold fast the other's image. ", "There were things he had to say to her before they parted, but he could not say them in that place of summer memories, and he turned and followed her in silence to the sleigh. ", "As they drove away the sun sank behind the hill and the pine-boles turned from red to grey. ", "By a devious track between the fields they wound back to the Starkfield road. ", "Under the open sky the light was still clear, with a reflection of cold red on the eastern hills. ", "The clumps of trees in the snow seemed to draw together in ruffled lumps, like birds with their heads under their wings; ", "and the sky, as it paled, rose higher, leaving the earth more alone. ", "As they turned into the Starkfield road Ethan said: ", "Matt, what do you mean to do? ", "\" She did not answer at once, but at length she said: ", "\"I'll try to get a place in a store.\" ", "\"You know you can't do it. ", "The bad air and the standing all day nearly killed you before.\" ", "\"I'm a lot stronger than I was before I came to Starkfield.\" ", "\"And now you're going to throw away all the good it's done you!\" ", "There seemed to be no answer to this, and again they drove on for a while without speaking. ", "With every yard of the way some spot where they had stood, and laughed together or been silent, clutched at Ethan and dragged him back. ", "Isn't there any of your father's folks could help you?\" ", "\"There isn't any of 'em I'd ask.\" ", "He lowered his voice to say: ", "You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you if I could.\" ", "\"I know there isn't.\" ", "\"But I can't-\"   ", "She was silent, but he felt a slight tremor in the shoulder against his. \" ", "Oh, Matt,\" he broke out, \"if I could ha' gone with you now I'd ha' done it-\"   ", "She turned to him, pulling a scrap of paper from her breast. \" ", "Ethan-I found this,\" she stammered. ", "Even in the failing light he saw it was the letter to his wife that he had begun the night before and forgotten to destroy. ", "Through his astonishment there ran a fierce thrill of joy. \" ", "Matt-\" he cried; ", "if I could ha' done it, would you?\" ", "\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan-what's the use? ", "\" With a sudden movement she tore the letter in shreds and sent them fluttering off into the snow. ", "\"Tell me, Matt! ", "Tell me!\" ", "he adjured her. ", "She was silent for a moment; ", "then she said, in such a low tone that he had to stoop his head to hear her: ", "\"I used to think of it sometimes, summer nights when the moon was so bright. ", "I couldn't sleep.\" ", "His heart reeled with the sweetness of it. ", "As long ago as that? ", "\" She answered, as if the date had long been fixed for her: ", "The first time was at Shadow Pond.\" ", "\"Was that why you gave me my coffee before the others?\" ", "\"I don't know. ", "Did I? ", "I was dreadfully put out when you wouldn't go to the picnic with me; ", "and then, when I saw you coming down the road, I thought maybe you'd gone home that way o' purpose; ", "and that made me glad. ", "\" They were silent again. ", "They had reached the point where the road dipped to the hollow by Ethan's mill and as they descended the darkness descended with them, dropping down like a black veil from the heavy hemlock boughs. ", "\"I'm tied hand and foot, Matt. ", "There isn't a thing I can do,\" he began again. ", "\"You must write to me sometimes, Ethan.\" ", "\"Oh, what good'll writing do? ", "I want to put my hand out and touch you. ", "I want to do for you and care for you. ", "I want to be there when you're sick and when you're lonesome.\" ", "\"You mustn't think but what I'll do all right.\" ", "\"You won't need me, you mean? ", "I suppose you'll marry!\" ", "\"Oh, Ethan!\" she cried. ", "\"I don't know how it is you make me feel, Matt. ", "I'd a'most rather have you dead than that!\" ", "\"Oh, I wish I was, I wish I was! ", "she sobbed. ", "The sound of her weeping shook him out of his dark anger, and he felt ashamed. \" ", "Don't let's talk that way,\" he whispered. ", "\"Why shouldn't we, when it's true? ", "I've been wishing it every minute of the day.\" ", "\"Matt! ", "You be quiet! ", "Don't you say it.\" ", "\"There's never anybody been good to me but you.\" ", "\"Don't say that either, when I can't lift a hand for you!\" ", "\"Yes; ", "but it's true just the same. ", "\" They had reached the top of School House Hill and Starkfield lay below them in the twilight. ", "A cutter, mounting the road from the village, passed them by in a joyous flutter of bells, and they straightened themselves and looked ahead with rigid faces. ", "Along the main street lights had begun to shine from the house-fronts and stray figures were turning in here and there at the gates. ", "Ethan, with a touch of his whip, roused the sorrel to a languid trot. ", "As they drew near the end of the village the cries of children reached them, and they saw a knot of boys, with sleds behind them, scattering across the open space before the church. ", "\"I guess this'll be their last coast for a day or two,\" Ethan said, looking up at the mild sky. ", "Mattie was silent, and he added: ", "We were to have gone down last night. ", "\" Still she did not speak and, prompted by an obscure desire to help himself and her through their miserable last hour, he went on discursively: ", "Ain't it funny we haven't been down together but just that once last winter? ", "She answered: ", "It wasn't often I got down to the village.\" ", "\"That's so,\" he said. ", "They had reached the crest of the Corbury road, and between the indistinct white glimmer of the church and the black curtain of the Varnum spruces the slope stretched away below them without a sled on its length.

", "\" All right, Matt?\" he called out, as if the width of the road had been between them. ", "She turned her head to say: ", "It's dreadfully dark. ", "Are you sure you can see?\" ", "He laughed contemptuously: ", "I could go down this coast with my eyes tied!\" ", "and she laughed with him, as if she liked his audacity. ", "Nevertheless he sat still a moment, straining his eyes down the long hill, for it was the most confusing hour of the evening, the hour when the last clearness from the upper sky is merged with the rising night in a blur that disguises landmarks and falsifies distances. \" ", "Now!\" he cried. ", "The sled started with a bound, and they flew on through the dusk, gathering smoothness and speed as they went, with the hollow night opening out below them and the air singing by like an organ. ", "Mattie sat perfectly still, but as they reached the bend at the foot of the hill, where the big elm thrust out a deadly elbow, he fancied that she shrank a little closer. \" ", "Don't be scared, Matt!\" ", "he cried exultantly, as they spun safely past it and flew down the second slope; ", "and when they reached the level ground beyond, and the speed of the sled began to slacken, he heard her give a little laugh of glee.

", "They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. ", "I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.

", "The younger of the two was a stranger to me. ", "She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. ", "If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it-indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in. ", "The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise-she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression-then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. ", "\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\" ", "She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. ", "That was a way she had. ", "She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. ", "(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; ", "an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) ", "At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again-the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. ", "Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. ", "Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. ", "I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. ", "It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. ", "Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth-but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: ", "a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. ", "I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. \" ", "Do they miss me?\" ", "she cried ecstatically. ", "\"The whole town is desolate. ", "All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.\" ", "\"How gorgeous!

", "\"What you doing, Nick?\" ", "\"I'm a bond man.\" ", "\"Who with?\" I told him. \" ", "Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively. ", "This annoyed me. ", "\"You will,\" I answered shortly. ", "\" You will if you stay in the East.\" ", "\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. ", "\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\" ", "At this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I started-it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.

", "Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. ", "They were here-and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. ", "They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. ", "It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. ", "\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. \" ", "Can't you talk about crops or something?

", "\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. ", "Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\" ", "\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone. ", "Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. ", "The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be-will be utterly submerged. ", "It's all scientific stuff; ", "it's been proved.\" ", "\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. \" ", "He reads deep books with long words in them.

", "Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. ", "The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. ", "The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone-fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. ", "Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens. ", "I decided to call to him. ", "Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. ", "But I didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone-he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. ", "Involuntarily I glanced seaward-and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.

", "But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. ", "The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour.

", "Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. ", "She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. ", "Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: ", "\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\" ", "\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. ", "A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity-except his wife, who moved close to Tom. ", "\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. ", "\" Get on the next train.\" ", "\"All right.\" ", "\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\" ", "She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.

", "Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.

", "I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way. ", "The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. ", "She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. ", "She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways, for an hour!

", "\" I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. ", "She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. ", "I was. ", "Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? ", "The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. ", "His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years-even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man. ", "That was nineteen-seventeen. ", "By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often. ", "She went with a slightly older crowd-when she went with anyone at all. ", "Wild rumors were circulating about her-how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. ", "She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. ", "After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't get into the army at all. ", "By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. ", "She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. ", "In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. ", "He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. ", "I was bridesmaid. ", "I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress-and as drunk as a monkey.

", "But she didn't say another word. ", "We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. ", "Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months' trip to the South Seas. ", "I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back ", "and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. ", "If he left the room for a minute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. ", "She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. ", "It was touching to see them together-it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. ", "That was in August. ", "A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car. ", "The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken-she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. ", "The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year. ", "I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. ", "Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. ", "They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. ", "Perhaps because she doesn't drink. ", "It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. ", "You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. ", "Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all-and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . . ", "Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. ", "It was when I asked you-do you remember?-if ", "you knew Gatsby in West Egg. ", "After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him-I was half asleep-she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. ", "It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car. ", "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park. ", "The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight: ", "      \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,     Your love belongs to me.

", "\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\" ", "\"Why not?\" ", "\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay. ", "\" Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. ", "He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor. ", "\"He wants to know-\" continued Jordan \"-if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.\" ", "The modesty of the demand shook me. ", "He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden. \" ", "Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\" ", "\"He's afraid. ", "He's waited so long. ", "He thought you might be offended. ", "You see he's a regular tough underneath it all. ", "\" Something worried me. \" ", "Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\" ", "\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. ", "\" And your house is right next door.\" ", "\"Oh!\" ", "\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. ", "Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. ", "It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. ", "Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York-and I thought he'd go mad: ", " \" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' ", "he kept saying. ' ", "I want to see her right next door.' ", "\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon the whole idea. ", "He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name. ", "\" It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. ", "Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. ", "A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: ", "There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\" ", "\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me. \" ", "Does she want to see Gatsby?\" ", "\"She's not to know about it. ", "Gatsby doesn't want her to know. ", "You're just supposed to invite her to tea. ", "\" We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. ", "Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. ", "Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face. ", "Chapter 5    When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. ", "Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. ", "Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar. ", "At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the house thrown open to the game. ", "But there wasn't a sound. ", "Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. ", "As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn. ", "\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said. ", "\"Does it?\" ", "He turned his eyes toward it absently. ", "\" I have been glancing into some of the rooms. ", "Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. ", "In my car. ", "\"It's too late.\" ", "\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool?

", "\" I don't want to put you to any trouble.\" ", "\"What day would suit you?\" ", "\"What day would suit YOU?\" ", "he corrected me quickly. ", "\" I don't want to put you to any trouble, you see.\" ", "\"How about the day after tomorrow? ", "He considered for a moment. ", "Then, with reluctance: ", " \"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said. ", "We both looked at the grass-there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. ", "I suspected that he meant my grass. ", "\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated. \" ", "Would you rather put it off for a few days? ", "\" I asked. ", "\"Oh, it isn't about that. ", "At least--\" He fumbled with a series of beginnings. ", "\" Why, I thought-why, look here, old sport, you don't make much money, do you?\" ", "\"Not very much. ", "\" This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.

", "\" I'm much obliged but I couldn't take on any more work.\" ", "\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem.\" ", "Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. ", "He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home. ", "The evening had made me light-headed and happy; ", "I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. ", "So I didn't know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into rooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on.

", "Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain. ", "For half a minute there wasn't a sound. ", "Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note.

", "\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. ", "His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. ", "Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place. ", "Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand. ", "\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said. ", "My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. ", "I couldn't muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head. ", "\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.

", "\"Five years next November. ", "\" The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. ", "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. ", "Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. ", "Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. ", "However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet. ", "\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm. ", "\"I'll be back.\" ", "\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\" ", "He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: ", "\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.

", "I walked out the back way-just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before-and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. ", "Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. ", "There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. ", "A brewer had built it early in the \"period\" craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. ", "Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family-he went into an immediate decline. ", "His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door.

", "After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner-I felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. ", "A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. ", "It was time I went back. ", "While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of emotion. ", "But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too. ", "I went in-after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove-but I don't believe they heard a sound. ", "They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. ", "Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.

", "People who do interesting things. ", "Celebrated people. ", "Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. ", "With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. ", "It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. ", "And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. ", "As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College Library\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. ", "We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths-intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. ", "It was Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder. ", "\" I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. ", "Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. ", "He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. ", "Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. ", "Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs. ", "His bedroom was the simplest room of all-except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. ", "Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. ", "\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. ", "\" I can't-when I try to--\"   ", "He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. ", "After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. ", "He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. ", "Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock. ", "Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. ", "\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. ", "He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\" ", "He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. ", "While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher-shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. ", "Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. ", "\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. ", "\" It makes me sad because I've never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.\" ", "After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers-but outside Gatsby's window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. ", "\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said Gatsby. ", "\" You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock. ", "Daisy put her arm through his abruptly ", "but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. ", "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. ", "Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. ", "It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. ", "Now it was again a green light on a dock. ", "His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. ", "I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. ", "A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. ", "\"Who's this?\" ", "\"That? ", "That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport. ", "\" The name sounded faintly familiar. ", "He's dead now. ", "He used to be my best friend years ago.

", "\" I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; ", "perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone. ", "\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the piano. ", "He went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. ", "He was now decently clothed in a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue. \" ", "Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely. ", "\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. ", "\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep.

", "Almost five years! ", "There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams-not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. ", "It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. ", "He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. ", "No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart. ", "As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. ", "His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.

", "They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; ", "Gatsby didn't know me now at all. ", "I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. ", "Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together. ", "Chapter 6    About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say. ", "\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely. \" ", "Why,-any statement to give out. ", "\" It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. ", "This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see. ", "\" It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. ", "Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. ", "Contemporary legends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. ", "Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't easy to say. ", "James Gatz-that was really, or at least legally, his name. ", "He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career-when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. ", "It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour. ", "I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. ", "His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people-his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. ", "The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. ", "He was a son of God-a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that-and he must be about His Father's Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. ", "So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. ", "For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. ", "His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. ", "He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted. ", "But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. ", "The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. ", "A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. ", "Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. ", "For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; ", "they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing. ", "An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. ", "He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through. ", "Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore. ", "Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. ", "The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. ", "The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. ", "He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay. ", "To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. ", "I suppose he smiled at Cody-he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. ", "At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious. ", "A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap. ", "And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too. ", "He was employed in a vague personal capacity-while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about ", "and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. ", "The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent. ", "It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died. ", "I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty face-the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. ", "It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. ", "Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; ", "for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone. ", "And it was from Cody that he inherited money-a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. ", "He didn't get it. ", "He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. ", "He was left with his singularly appropriate education; ", "the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man. ", "He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. ", "Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. ", "So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away. ", "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. ", "For several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone-mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt-but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. ", "I hadn't been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. ", "I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before. ", "They were a party of three on horseback", "Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously. ", "\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch. ", "\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\" ", "As though they cared! ", "\"Sit right down. ", "Have a cigarette or a cigar. ", "He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. ", "\" I'll have something to drink for you in just a minute.\" ", "He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. ", "But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. ", "Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. ", "A lemonade? ", "No, thanks. ", "A little champagne? ", "Nothing at all, thanks. . ", ". . ", "I'm sorry--  \"Did you have a nice ride?\" ", "\"Very good roads around here.\" ", "\"I suppose the automobiles--\"  \"Yeah.\" ", "Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. ", "\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\" ", "\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering. ", "\"So we did. ", "I remember very well.\" ", "\"About two weeks ago. ", "\"That's right. ", "You were with Nick here.\" ", "\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively. ", "That so? ", "\" Tom turned to me. ", "\"You live near here, Nick?\" ", "\"Next door.\" ", "\"That so?\" ", "Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair; ", "the woman said nothing either-until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial. ", "\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested. ", "\"What do you say?\" ", "\"Certainly. ", "I'd be delighted to have you.\" ", "\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. ", "\" Well-think ought to be starting home.\" ", "\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. ", "He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. ", "\" Why don't you-why don't you stay for supper? ", "I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.\" ", "\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically. ", "Both of you. ", "\" This included me. ", "Mr. Sloane got to his feet. ", "\"Come along,\" he said-but to her only. ", "\"I mean it,\" she insisted. ", "\" I'd love to have you. ", "Lots of room. ", "\" Gatsby looked at me questioningly. ", "He wanted to go and he didn't see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't. ", "\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said. ", "\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby. ", "Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. ", "\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud. ", "\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. ", "\" I used to ride in the army ", "but I've never bought a horse. ", "I'll have to follow you in my car. ", "Excuse me for just a minute. ", "\" The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. ", "My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. ", "\" Doesn't he know she doesn't want him?\" ", "\"She says she does want him.\" ", "\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" ", "He frowned. ", "\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. ", "By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. ", "They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\" ", "Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses. \" ", "Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. ", "We've got to go.\" ", "And then to me: ", "Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\" ", "Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door. ", "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. ", "Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness-it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. ", "There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before. ", "Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. ", "It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment. ", "They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. ", "\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. ", "\" If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it for you. ", "Just mention my name. ", "Or present a green card. ", "I'm giving out green--\"  \"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby. ", "\"I'm looking around. ", "I'm having a marvelous--\"   ", "\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\" ", "Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd. ", "\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. ", "\" In fact I was just thinking I don't know a soul here.\" ", "\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" ", "Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. ", "Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies. ", "\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy. ", "The man bending over her is her director. ", "\" He took them ceremoniously from group to group: ", "\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . ", "and Mr. Buchanan--\" ", "After an instant's hesitation he added: ", "the polo player. ", "\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\" ", "But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo player\" for the rest of the evening. ", "\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" ", "Daisy exclaimed. ", "\" I liked that man-what was his name?-with the sort of blue nose.\" ", "Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.

", "But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now. ", "\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\" ", "The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. ", "At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes. ", "\"Wha?\" ", "A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence: ", "\"Oh, she's all right now.

", "\" Your hand shakes. ", "I wouldn't let you operate on me!\" ", "It was like that. ", "Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. ", "They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between.

", "\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\" ", "But the rest offended her-and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. ", "She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village-appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. ", "She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand. ", "I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. ", "It was dark here in front: ", "only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. ", "Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.

", "But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there-it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. ", "There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. ", "It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy-it increased her value in his eyes.

", "Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? ", "Maybe even if you haven't been there for a long time? ", "Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\" ", "\"Don't belong to any.\" ", "\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.

", "\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk. \" ", "Which drawer?\" ", "\"That drawer-that one.\" ", "Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. ", "There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. ", "It was apparently new. \" ", "This?\" he inquired, holding it up. ", "Wilson stared and nodded.

", "\"How could she of been like that?\" ", "\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.

", "\" This was a forlorn hope-he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: ", "there was not enough of him for his wife. ", "He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn't far off. ", "About five o'clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light. ", "Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind. ", "\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. ", "\" I told her she might fool me but she couldn't fool God. ", "I took her to the window-\" With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, \"-and I said 'God knows what you've been doing, everything you've been doing. ", "You may fool me but you can't fool God!' ", "\" Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night. ", "\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson. ", "\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. ", "Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. ", "But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight. ", "By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. ", "It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together. ", "Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; ", "when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone. ", "His movements-he was on foot all the time-were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didn't eat and a cup of coffee. ", "He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. ", "Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time-there were boys who had seen a man \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. ", "Then for three hours he disappeared from view. ", "The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had a way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. ", "On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward-and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. ", "By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house. ", "So by that time he knew Gatsby's name. ", "At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. ", "He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. ", "Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances-and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair. ", "Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. ", "Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees. ", "No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o'clock-until long after there was any one to give it to if it came. ", "I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. ", "If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. ", "He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. ", "A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about . . . ", "like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees. ", "The chauffeur-he was one of Wolfshiem's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s-heard the shots-afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much about them. ", "I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. ", "But they knew then, I firmly believe. ", "With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool. ", "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. ", "With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. ", "A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. ", "The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water. ", "It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. ", "Chapter 9    After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. ", "A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. ", "Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning. ", "Most of those reports were a nightmare-grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue. ", "When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade-but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn't say a word. ", "She showed a surprising amount of character about it too-looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. ", "She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. ", "So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by grief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. ", "And it rested there. ", "But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. ", "I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone. ", "From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. ", "At first I was surprised and confused; ", "then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested-interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end. ", "I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. ", "But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. \" ", "Left no address?\" ", "\"No.\" \"Say when they'd be back?\" ", "\"No.\" ", "\"Any idea where they are? ", "How I could reach them?\" ", "\"I don't know. ", "Can't say. ", "\" I wanted to get somebody for him.

", "\"Will you ring again?\" ", "\"I've rung them three times.\" ", "\"It's very important.\" ", "\"Sorry. ", "I'm afraid no one's there. ", "\" I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it.

", "You've got to try hard. ", "I can't go through this alone.\" ", "Some one started to ask me questions ", "but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk-he'd never told me definitely that his parents were dead. ", "But there was nothing-only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall. ", "Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. ", "That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. ", "I was sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before noon-but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.

", "We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again. ", "That's my middle west-not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. ", "I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name. ", "I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all-Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life. ", "Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old-even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. ", "West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams.

", "I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair. ", "She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. ", "When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. ", "I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised.

", "\" You threw me over on the telephone. ", "I don't give a damn about you now ", "but it was a new experience for me ", "and I felt a little dizzy for a while. ", "\" We shook hands. \" ", "Oh, and do you remember-\" she added, \"--a conversation we had once about driving a car?\" ", "\"Why-not exactly.\" ", "\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?

", "\"What's the matter, Nick? ", "Do you object to shaking hands with me?\" ", "\"Yes. ", "You know what I think of you.\" ", "\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \" ", "Crazy as hell.

", "\" He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs.

", "What if I did tell him? ", "That fellow had it coming to him. ", "He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough one. ", "He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car. ", "\" There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true. \" ", "And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering-look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. ", "By God it was awful--\"   ", "I couldn't forgive him or like him ", "but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. ", "It was all very careless and confused. ", "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . . ", "I shook hands with him; ", "it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. ", "Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace-or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons-rid of my provincial squeamishness forever. ", "Gatsby's house was still empty when I left-the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. ", "One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; ", "perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. ", "I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train. ", "I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive. ", "One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps. ", "But I didn't investigate. ", "Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over. ", "On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. ", "On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. ", "Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand. ", "Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. ", "And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes-a fresh, green breast of the new world. ", "Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; ", "for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder. ", "And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. ", "He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. ", "He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night. ", "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. ", "It eluded us then, but that's no matter-tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . ", "And one fine morning--   ", "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."]}
