This implies the missing quotation is a Latin phrase from Book 1 that contains nine words, and the analysis is discussing word division.\n\nSearching through the provided Book 1 text for a nine-word phrase that might be cited in such a grammatical or textual discussion, a likely candidate is the famous question in line 11:  \n**\"Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?\"**\n\nThis is three words in Latin, but if each word were separated (or if the note is treating each unit as a mask), it could be represented with three masks.

The analysis says:  \n“MASK’ apparently means ‘MASK MASK MASK’ so that the expression may be regarded as a condensed one for “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” or something of the kind.”  \n\nThis suggests the missing quotation is a repeated word or phrase. In Book 4 of the *Aeneid*, a famous repeated phrase occurs in line 569, where Mercury says to Aeneas:  \n**“Varium et mutabile semper femina.”**  \nBut the repetition pattern in the analysis more closely matches Dido’s curse in lines 625–629, where she repeats words in a parallel structure (“litora litoribus contraria, fluctibus undas … arma armis; pugnent ipsique nepotesque”).  \n\nHowever, the most likely candidate for a short, repeated phrase used in literary discussions is **“Italiam, Italiam”** (lines 345–346), where “Italiam” is repeated in the lines:  \n“Sed nunc Italiam magnam Gryneus Apollo, / Italiam Lyciae iussere capessere sortes”.  \nBut that’s only two repetitions, not the longer repetition pattern suggested.  \n\nGiven the analysis says “MASK MASK MASK” is a condensed form for a longer repetition, the most famous repeated word in Book 4 is **“moriamur”** from line 659: “sed moriamur ait. ‘Sic, sic iuvat ire sub umbras” — here “sic, sic” is repeated, not “moriamur” itself.  \n\nBut the line that fits a repeated single-word quotation in many commentaries is **“Italiam non sponte sequor”** (line 361) — but no repetition there.  \n\nGiven the phrasing in the analysis, the likely reference is to **line 569**: “Varium et mutabile semper femina” — often quoted in discussions of Dido’s tragedy, and sometimes the phrase “femina” is the repeated element in commentaries.  \n\nBut the clue “MASK MASK MASK” as a condensed form for a longer repetition might point to **lines 628–629**: “Litora litoribus contraria, fluctibus undas / imprecor, arma armis; pugnent ipsique nepotesque” — where “litora litoribus” and “arma armis” show the repetition pattern.  \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most probable match for a commonly cited phrase in literary analysis of Book 4 is **line 569**, because “Varium et mutabile semper femina” is a famous sententia often extracted and discussed.  \n\nThus, I’ll choose line 569.\n\n<line>569</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 614, "prompt_tokens": 11627, "total_tokens": 12241, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 11456, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0005913936, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000368648, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00025788}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

However, the literary analysis cites lines 181 and 222 with masks, meaning the missing quotations are *at* those lines, not necessarily mentioning Sergestus. The note about Sergestus is a separate observation, likely referring to his first appearance later in the book.  \n\nThe task is to identify the missing quotation at line 181 and line 222.  \n- Line 181: \"prospectum late pelago petit, Anthea si quem\"  \n- Line 222: \"fata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum\"  \n\nBut the literary analysis shows two masks for line 222, so likely two words are missing there. Looking at line 222 in the text: \"fata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum\" — if we mask two words, perhaps \"fata Lyci\" or \"fortemque Gyan\" etc. However, the analysis format suggests the citation is:  \n‘MASK’ v. 181, ‘MASK MASK’ v. 222.  \n\nSo the missing quotation at line 181 is one word, at line 222 is two words.  \n\nGiven the note about Sergestus, it might be that the literary analysis is discussing names mentioned — but line 181 contains \"Anthea\" (Antheus), line 222 contains \"Lyci, Gyan, Cloanthum\". Sergestus appears at 510, so the note is separate.  \n\nThus, the missing quotation at line 181 is likely \"Anthea\" (or \"Anthea\" as a proper noun). At line 222, likely \"fata Lyci\" (two words).  \n\nBut the question asks: \"identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears\" — since there are two masks, we need to give the line number for each? The instruction says: \"If the quotation spans multiple lines, provide the starting line number.\" But here we have two separate masked quotations, each with its own line number given in the analysis.  \n\nThe literary analysis excerpt already gives the line numbers (181 and 222), so the answer is simply those line numbers.  \n\nThus, final answer:  \n\n<line>181</line>  \n<line>222</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 674, "prompt_tokens": 12325, "total_tokens": 12999, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 12224, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0006162912, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000370552, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00028308}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

No, line 3 has “fumat” (present).\n\nGiven the clues, the most likely line referenced in textual criticism by Ribbeck is line 595, which is an extra line sometimes included:  \n**“et quondam patriis ad Troiam missus in armis.”**  \nBut that’s not an imperfect verb issue.\n\nPerhaps the imperfect verb is in line 615 “mansisset” (but that’s pluperfect subjunctive).  \nMaybe the imperfect is “habebat” in line 147: **“Nox erat, et terris animalia somnus habebat”** — “habebat” is imperfect where pluperfect “habuerat” might be expected in some interpretations.\n\nGiven the phrasing in the analysis, it seems the missing quotation is a phrase like **“animalia somnus habebat”** (line 147). But the analysis says “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” (five masks) then “For ‘MASK MASK’” (two masks). That suggests the full quotation is five words, and a variant two-word reading exists.\n\nIn line 147, “animalia somnus habebat” is three words.  \nA five-word phrase with an imperfect verb could be **“et terram altricem saevi exsecramur Ulixi”** (line 273) but that’s present tense.\n\nGiven the imperfect “habebat” in line 147 is notable, but not five words.  \nMaybe **“Nox erat, et terris animalia somnus habebat”** is exactly five words in Latin: “Nox erat et terris animalia somnus habebat” (counting “et” as separate). That’s six words? Let’s check: Nox (1), erat (2), et (3), terris (4), animalia (5), somnus (6), habebat (7) — seven words.\n\nGiven the difficulty, the most cited line in such textual discussions in Aeneid 3 is line 595 (the extra line), and Ribbeck’s cursives are often mentioned regarding it.\n\nThus, I’ll choose line 595 as the most probable match.\n\n<line>595</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 979, "prompt_tokens": 11764, "total_tokens": 12743, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 11584, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.000748881, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000374752, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00041118}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
