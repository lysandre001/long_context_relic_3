The excerpt shows a pattern with \"MASK MASK MASK\" appearing multiple times, suggesting a phrase of about 3 words that demonstrates this grammatical phenomenon.\n\nSearching through the text for relative clause constructions, I find several candidates. Given the context about antecedent-relative clause transfers and the reference to line 546, I should look for passages with \"qui/quae/quod\" (relative pronouns) where an attribute seems transferred.\n\nOne notable passage that fits this pattern is:\n\n\"quam nec longa dies, pietas nec mitigat ulla\"\n\nThis shows a construction where the attribute could be seen as transferred between clauses. However, looking more carefully at the pattern of the masks and the grammatical discussion, I need to find a phrase around line 546 or similar.\n\nLooking at the structure more carefully, a strong candidate appears to be:\n\n\"cui genus et quondam nomen natique fuissent\"\n\nThis shows the kind of relative clause construction being discussed, where attributes are distributed in a particular way for metrical purposes.\n\n<window>cui genus et quondam nomen natique fuissent</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 14296, "total_tokens": 14679, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04814667, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.042888, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005745}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

Third MASK: possibly continues the comparison or provides context\n\nLet me search for notable similes in Book 2. One of the most famous similes involves Androgeos and the serpent:\n\n\"inprovisum aspris veluti qui sentibus anguem pressit humi nitens, trepidusque repente refugit attollentem iras et caerula colla tumentem\"\n\nThis compares Androgeos's reaction to someone stepping on a snake.\n\nAnother notable simile compares the fall of Troy to a tree:\n\"ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant eruere agricolae certatim\"\n\nHowever, looking at the pattern more carefully, the analysis seems to be making a brief comparison. Let me look for shorter, more direct comparisons.\n\nGiven the fragmentary nature and the pattern suggesting a comparison of similar phrases, I should look for a concise window that would work in such a comparative analysis. A likely candidate would be a brief simile marker or comparative phrase.\n\nThe window \"veluti\" (meaning \"just as\" or \"like\") appears multiple times and is a key comparative term in Virgil's similes.\n\n<window>veluti</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 13279, "total_tokens": 13677, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04534893, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.039837, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00597}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
