However, looking more carefully at the pattern of the masks and the grammatical discussion, I need to find a phrase around line 546 or similar.\n\nLooking at the structure more carefully, a strong candidate appears to be:\n\n\"cui genus et quondam nomen natique fuissent\"\n\nThis shows the kind of relative clause construction being discussed, where attributes are distributed in a particular way for metrical purposes.\n\n<window>cui genus et quondam nomen natique fuissent</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 14296, "total_tokens": 14679, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04814667, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.042888, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005745}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

Let me look for shorter, more direct comparisons.\n\nGiven the fragmentary nature and the pattern suggesting a comparison of similar phrases, I should look for a concise window that would work in such a comparative analysis. A likely candidate would be a brief simile marker or comparative phrase.\n\nThe window \"veluti\" (meaning \"just as\" or \"like\") appears multiple times and is a key comparative term in Virgil's similes.\n\n<window>veluti</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 13279, "total_tokens": 13677, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04534893, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.039837, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00597}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

In this line, \"fuit\" is indeed part of the predicate (\"fuit Ilium\") and parallels \"fuimus Troes.\" This matches the analysis's focus on \"fuit\" forming part of a predicate.\n\nThus, the window that best supports the claims in the literary analysis is the line containing \"fuit Ilium.\"\n\n<window>fuit Ilium</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 12089, "total_tokens": 12326, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.003200868, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00314314, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 9.006e-05}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The excerpt mentions \"v. 578., 7. 285., 11. 190.\" which likely refers to line numbers in the Aeneid (Book 5 line 578, Book 7 line 285, Book 11 line 190). The analysis then states: \"‘MASK’ after ‘MASK MASK’ as Henry has seen, not, as Forb. thinks, following Serv., after ‘MASK MASK’\". This suggests a debate about the placement of a word or phrase in the text, specifically whether a certain word comes after a certain two-word phrase or after a different two-word phrase.\n\nGiven that the provided text is only from Book 5, we need to find a window in Book 5 that fits this pattern. The line number cited for Book 5 is 578. Looking at the text around line 578 (by counting lines roughly from the start), we find:\n\nThe lines around that area describe the footrace. After Nisus slips, Euryalus wins. The specific line 578 in many editions corresponds to: **\"prima tenet, plausuque volat fremituque secundo.\"**\n\nHowever, the literary analysis seems to be about a specific textual sequence. The phrase \"MASK MASK\" likely represents a two-word phrase, and \"MASK\" a single word that comes after it. Given the context of line 578 and the surrounding lines, a likely candidate for the debated sequence is **\"prima tenet\"** (two words) followed by **\"plausuque\"** (one word). But the analysis says Henry thinks \"MASK\" comes after \"MASK MASK\", while Forb. thinks, following Servius, it comes after a different \"MASK MASK\". This implies there are two possible two-word phrases in the vicinity.\n\nLooking more closely at lines 576-580:\n> Emicat Euryalus, et munere victor amici  \n> **prima tenet**, plausuque volat fremituque secundo.  \n> Post Helymus subit, et nunc tertia palma Diores.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"prima tenet\" (he holds first place). After that comes \"plausuque\" (and with applause). But perhaps the debate is about whether \"plausuque\" comes after \"prima tenet\" or after something else like \"victor amici\"? However, \"victor amici\" is not directly adjacent.\n\nGiven the line numbers cited (5.578, 7.285, 11.190), the analysis is likely pointing to a recurring phrase or formula. In Book 5 line 578, the phrase \"plausuque volat fremituque secundo\" contains \"plausuque\". Perhaps the debate is about the placement of \"plausuque\" after \"prima tenet\" vs. after another phrase.\n\nBut to match the pattern in the analysis exactly: The analysis has three masks total: one single mask after two masks. That is, [two-word phrase] then [one word]. The line in question is \"prima tenet, plausuque...\". So the two-word phrase is \"prima tenet\", and the one word immediately following is \"plausuque\". However, in the Latin, there is a comma, but the words are adjacent.\n\nThus, the window that best fits as the cited quotation for the literary analysis debate is likely the three-word sequence that includes the two-word phrase and the following word: **\"prima tenet plausuque\"**. This matches the pattern of \"MASK MASK\" (prima tenet) followed by \"MASK\" (plausuque).\n\nTherefore, the selected window is:\n\n<window>prima tenet plausuque</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 825, "prompt_tokens": 13151, "total_tokens": 13976, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0036954324, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00341926, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0003135}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The excerpt cites “MASK MASK MASK” and references Horace (Hor. 2 S. 3. 305) as an example or parallel.\n\nIn the provided text of Aeneid Book 3, I need to find a window where a neuter plural is used as a substantive (i.e., as a noun) in either the nominative or accusative case. A clear example is in line 659: “omnia conlustrans” – but that’s not a substantive neuter plural by itself. A better example is earlier: “omnia” is often used as a substantive (“all things”), but the analysis likely points to a specific phrase.\n\nA strong candidate is “omnia” in the accusative case as a substantive. For instance, in line 664: “Vos animam hanc potius quocumque absumite leto.” That doesn’t contain the needed form. However, earlier in Achaemenides’ speech, line 658: “dant rami et volsis pascunt radicibus herbae” – not it.\n\nActually, a notable example of a neuter plural substantive in the accusative is “bella” (wars) or “arma” (arms), but those are common. The analysis might refer to a specific phrase from the Aeneid that illustrates this grammatical point. Given the reference to Horace, the “MASK” likely stands for a quoted phrase from Vergil.\n\nSearching the text, a good match is in line 539: “venturaque bella” – but that’s not a standalone substantive. Another possibility is in line 246: “tristia dona” – but that’s an adjective-noun phrase.\n\nA clearer example of a neuter plural substantive in the accusative is “arma” in line 288: “AENEAS HAEC DE DANAIS VICTORIBVS ARMA.” Here “arma” is accusative plural, meaning “arms,” used as a substantive.\n\nBut the analysis says “the neuter pl. as a substantive seems commoner in the nom. and acc.” So I need a neuter plural word in nom. or acc. acting as a noun. In line 55, we have “Sacra Dionaeae matri divisque ferebam” – “Sacra” (sacred things) is neuter plural accusative substantive.\n\nHowever, the most famous example from Aeneid 3 is perhaps “omnia” in line 664 isn’t right. Let’s look at line 657: “Victum infelicem, bacas lapidosaque corna,” – “bacas” and “corna” are feminine and neuter, but “corna” is neuter plural accusative substantive meaning “cornels.”\n\nBut the analysis cites Horace, so maybe the Vergilian example is a well-known grammatical illustration. I recall that in Aeneid 3, line 664 is not it. Perhaps line 56: “auspicibus coeptorum operum” – “operum” is genitive, not nom/acc.\n\nWait, the analysis says “This use of the neuter pl. as a substantive seems commoner in the nom. and acc.” The example from Vergil might be a phrase like “tristia dona” (line 246) but that’s accusative. Or “multa monstra” etc.\n\nGiven the context, a likely candidate is “tristia dona” from line 246, which is in the accusative case and means “sad gifts,” with “tristia” being neuter plural adjective used substantively? Actually, “dona” is neuter plural noun, but “tristia” is an adjective agreeing with it. Not a pure substantive use of an adjective.\n\nPerhaps the phrase is “omnia” used substantively.

The excerpt includes a quotation from Servius (the ancient commentator on Virgil) that is masked. Servius’s commentary often explains difficult phrases or interprets lines.\n\nGiven the structure, the masked portion is likely a direct quotation from *Aeneid* Book 6 that Servius is discussing. The most plausible candidate is a famous or notable phrase from Book 6 that appears around line 322 or that is referenced in line 8.36 of the commentary.\n\nChecking the text of Book 6, line 322 is part of Aeneas’s speech to the Sibyl:  \n*“si potuit Manes arcessere coniugis Orpheus”* (“If Orpheus was able to summon the shade of his wife…”).  \nThis line is often commented on by Servius in relation to mythological parallels.\n\nHowever, the literary analysis excerpt says “See on v. 322 below” and then gives Servius’s remark in the mask. That means the mask is likely Servius’s words, not Virgil’s. But the instruction says: “select a window from aeneid_book6 that most appropriately replaces <MASK> as the cited quotation by providing textual evidence for any claims in the literary analysis.” This implies the mask in the literary analysis is a quote from Virgil that Servius is explaining.\n\nGiven the line reference “8. 36” (which might mean Book 8, line 36, but we are only given Book 6 text), this seems inconsistent unless it’s a footnote reference to another book. But since we only have Book 6, the likely relevant Virgil quote in Servius’s remark is the one Servius is explaining — possibly a phrase like *“facilis descensus Averno”* (line 126) or another famous line.\n\nGiven the clues, the most famous line in Book 6 that Servius often comments on is *“facilis descensus Averno”* (easy is the descent to Avernus). That appears at line 126. But line 322 is different.  \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I’ll choose the line actually at 322 in Book 6, since the note says “See on v. 322 below” — meaning the note is about that line, so Servius’s remark in the mask is probably explaining something in or around that line. The mask in the literary analysis is Servius’s remark, but the question asks for the window from *Aeneid* Book 6 that replaces the mask as the cited quotation — so the mask must be a Virgil quote, not Servius’s words. Possibly the literary analysis excerpt has the Virgil quote first, then the Servius note.  \n\nGiven the format:  \n“MASK MASK MASK” 8. 36. See on v. 322 below. Serv. rather ingeniously remarks, “MASK MASK MASK…”  \nThe first mask is likely the Virgil quote, the second mask is Servius’s remark.\n\nThe Virgil quote is probably from Book 6, line 322: *“si potuit Manes arcessere coniugis Orpheus”*.

The excerpt mentions scholars (Forb., Jahn, Ribbeck) restoring a reading from manuscripts Med., Rom., and Gud., as opposed to the reading in fragm. Veron. It also mentions a stop after a certain word and references verse 175.\n\nThe key is that the literary analysis is discussing a specific disputed phrase. The phrase in question is likely one where manuscripts differ. In many editions of Aeneid 4, a famous disputed passage is the line describing the union of Dido and Aeneas in the cave (around lines 165-175). A common variant involves the words \"coniugium\" and \"hymenaeus.\"\n\nIn the provided text, the relevant section is:\n> *Speluncam Dido dux et Troianus eandem*  \n> *deveniunt. prima et Tellus et pronuba Iuno*  \n> *dant signum; fulsere ignes et conscius aether*  \n> ***conubiis, summoque ulularunt vertice nymphae.***  \n> ***Ille dies primus leti primusque malorum***  \n> ***causa fuit; neque enim specie famave movetur,***  \n> ***nec iam furtivum Dido meditatur amorem:***  \n> ***coniugium vocat; hoc praetexit nomine culpam.***  \n\nThe literary analysis seems to be debating the exact wording in line 169 or thereabouts. The phrase \"coniugium vocat\" is a key candidate. However, the analysis explicitly quotes a portion of the Latin text with <MASK> placeholders. Given the discussion of variants, the likely masked phrase is the one where manuscripts differ: **\"coniugium vocat\"** vs. something like **\"hymenaeus\"** or **\"hymenaeum\"** (as seen in some manuscript traditions).\n\nIn the provided text, line 172 is \"conubium\" in some editions, but here it's \"conubiis\" in line 168. The direct phrase in question in many textual debates is **\"coniugium vocat\"** (line 172). The literary analysis mentions \"v. 175\" and a stop after a word, which fits the punctuation after \"culpam\" or earlier.\n\nGiven the clues, the most likely window is the phrase containing the variant reading. In many commentaries, the disputed line is exactly **\"conubium vocat\"** or **\"hymenaeum vocat\"**.

It references a \"half-echo\" of Aeneid 4.451.\n2. It points to line 5.769 as a reminder by \"similar structure\" and \"contrasted sense.\"\n3. It states that the feeling in the masked quotation is \"the key-note of the Aeneid.\"\n4. It cites lines 5.631 ff. and other passages like 1.437 as comparable.\n\nThe analysis is discussing a line in Book 5 that contrasts with line 5.769. Line 5.769 is: **\"O nimium caelo et pelago confise sereno\"** (\"O too trusting in a calm sky and sea\").\n\nLooking for a line with similar structure but opposite meaning earlier in Book 5, the most likely candidate is line 5.21-22, where Palinurus says:  \n**\"Magnanime Aenea, non, si mihi Iuppiter auctor / spondeat, hoc sperem Italiam contingere caelo.\"**  \nBut this is not a perfect structural match.\n\nHowever, the analysis says the masked quotation expresses a feeling that is the \"key-note of the Aeneid\"—often interpreted as a sense of loss, sorrow, or tragic duty. In Book 5, a prominent line fitting this tone is Aeneas's lament for Palinurus at the end: **\"O nimium caelo et pelago confise sereno\"** (5.769) is about misplaced trust in calm. But the analysis says line 5.769 is meant to remind us of the *present line* (the masked one) by *contrasted sense*. So the masked line should express the opposite—perhaps trust in divine support or certainty.\n\nGiven the reference to 4.451 (Dido's lament \"vixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi\"), and the \"key-note\" of the Aeneid being fate and suffering, a likely candidate is Aeneas's statement of duty and sorrow earlier in Book 5.  \n\nThe clearest match in structure to 5.769 and with opposite meaning is actually earlier in Book 5, when Aeneas speaks of the anniversary of Anchises' death:  \n**\"semper honoratum (sic di voluistis) habebo\"** (5.49–50) — \"I shall always hold it honored (so you gods have willed).\"  \nBut this doesn’t match the \"half-echo\" of 4.451 closely.\n\nInstead, the line that is a half-echo of 4.451 and fits the \"key-note\" of tragic destiny is in Aeneas's speech at the tomb:  \n**\"Non licuit fines Italos fataliaque arva, / nec tecum Ausonium (quicumque est) quaerere Thybrim.\"** (5.82–83) — \"It was not allowed to reach the Italian borders and the fated fields, nor with you to seek the Ausonian Tiber, whatever it is.\"\n\nBut the analysis likely refers to a shorter, poignant phrase. Given the clues, the most probable masked quotation is Aeneas's lament for his father at the tomb, which echoes Dido's despair in Book 4. The phrase that matches the tone and is cited elsewhere in commentaries is:  \n**\"salve, sancte parens, iterum salvete, recepti / nequiquam cineres\"** (5.80–81) — \"Hail, holy father, again hail, ashes received in vain.\"\n\nHowever, the analysis says the masked quotation is meant to be recalled later by 5.769 with contrasted sense. The contrasted sense would be between trusting in calm (5.769) and trusting in divine will or accepting fate sorrowfully.\n\nGiven the structural similarity to 5.769 noted in the analysis, the best match is the line where Aeneas expresses trust in divine guidance, which contrasts with Palinurus's overconfidence in calm weather. That line is:  \n**\"haud equidem sine mente, reor, sine numine divom\"** (5.56) — \"not without purpose, I think, not without divine will.\"\n\nBut this is not a direct echo of 4.451.\n\nGiven standard commentaries, the line often cited as the key-note of the Aeneid in Book 5 is Aeneas's lament:  \n**\"heu, miserae cives! non hostem inimicaque castra / Argivum, vestras spes uritis.\"** (5.670–671) — \"Alas, wretched citizens! It is not the enemy or hostile Argive camp you burn, but your own hopes.\"\n\nBut the analysis says the masked quotation is recalled by 5.769 by similar structure and contrasted sense. The only line with clear similar structure (O + vocative + description) is 5.769 itself, so the \"half-echo\" of 4.451 might be a different line.\n\nAfter checking, the half-echo of 4.451 in Book 5 is at 5.725: **\"heu tot vada fessis / et tantum superesse maris\"** — \"Alas, so many shoals for the weary, and so much sea still left.\" This echoes Dido's \"vixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi\" in sense of weariness and fate.\n\nThat fits the \"key-note\" of the Aeneid (weariness, suffering) and is recalled by 5.769 (trust in calm) with contrasted sense—one is despair at the sea left, the other is overconfidence in calm sea.\n\nThus, the window is:\n\n<window>heu tot vada fessis et tantum superesse maris</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1230, "prompt_tokens": 13189, "total_tokens": 14419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 13184, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0008450568, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000370552, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0005166}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
