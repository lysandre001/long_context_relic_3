In Aeneid Book 2, this occurs when Aeneas describes visiting the house of Deiphobus and seeing the destruction there.\n\nThe passage about Deiphobus's house and the fierce fighting appears around lines 310-312 and then more extensively around lines 438-440 in Book 2. Given that the analysis specifically mentions \"v. 440\" and discusses the comparison structure, this is clearly referring to the passage around line 440.\n\nLooking at the context, the analysis discusses how Virgil writes loosely about a comparison, and mentions line 440 specifically. The passage being analyzed would be the description of the fighting at Deiphobus's house, which centers around lines 438-440, with the specific reference point being the comparison that extends from this area.\n\nGiven the specific mention of \"v. 440\" in the excerpt and the discussion of the comparison structure, the line being referenced is:\n\n<line>440</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 364, "prompt_tokens": 460, "total_tokens": 824, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0067716, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00138, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00546}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
