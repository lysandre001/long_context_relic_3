The analysis mentions that the author \"added\" something (\"addidit\") in contrast to places where he \"subtracted\" (\"subtraxerit\").\n\nA relevant passage appears to be:\n\"Hic Mars armipotens animum viresque Latinis addidit\"\n\nThis contains \"addidit\" which matches the literary analysis's discussion. The phrase \"animum viresque\" (spirit and strength) uses the accusative case as direct objects.\n\nHowever, the analysis is specifically about genitive vs ablative usage. Let me look more carefully.\n\nThe phrase \"cuius rei\" in the analysis suggests we need to find where a genitive of \"res\" (thing/matter) is used. \n\nLooking at the text, I find: \"quod cuique tuendum est\" - but this doesn't quite fit.\n\nActually, examining more closely, I see \"certorum rerum\" type constructions aren't prominent. But there's \"rerum\" appearing in contexts like \"regni de rebus\" and \"quaeretur gloria rebus.\"\n\nGiven the context about adding vs subtracting, and the reference to \"cuius rei,\" the most likely window is:\n\n<window>cuius rei</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 13293, "total_tokens": 13696, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04546476, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.039879, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.006045}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The pattern \"MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK\" (seven words) and \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" (four words) suggests the analysis is pointing to examples of a repeated structure, likely a series of words in the same case or a parallel construction.\n\nIn the provided text of Aeneid Book 8, a notable example of a seven-word series in the same grammatical case (ablative) is found in the description of the Cyclopes forging the shield:\n\n**\"Tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae addiderant, rutili tris ignis et alitis austri\"**\n\nHowever, this is not exactly seven consecutive words in the same form. A clearer example of a consecutive series in the same case is the list of materials or descriptions. Another strong candidate is the series of ablatives in the description of the underworld punishments:\n\n**\"et scelerum poenas et te, Catilina, minaci pendentem scopulo Furiarumque ora trementem\"**\n\nBut this doesn't match a simple consecutive series of the same case.\n\nA more fitting example for a seven-word series might be the description of the shield's imagery:  \n**\"Hinc ope barbarica variisque Antonius armis\"** — but this is too short.\n\nGiven the analysis format, it seems to be quoting two examples: one seven-word phrase and one four-word phrase. In Virgil, a common stylistic feature is the use of a polysyndeton (multiple \"et\" or \"que\") or asyndeton (no conjunctions). A famous example of an asyndetic list in Aeneid 8 is in the description of the Cyclopes working:\n\n**\"Brontesque Steropesque et nudus membra Pyragmon.\"** — This is only four words if we take \"Brontesque Steropesque et nudus\" but that breaks the names.\n\nActually, a better candidate for a four-word series might be:  \n**\"ferrum acuant portis in me exscidiumque meorum\"** — but not perfectly parallel.\n\nHowever, the most likely match for the pattern in literary analysis of Virgil is the **four-word phrase \"arma acri facienda viro\"** (line 441) and the **seven-word phrase \"terribilem cristis galeam flammasque vomentem\"** (line 620)? Not quite.\n\nLooking more carefully, the analysis seems to be filling in blanks with words from the text to illustrate a grammatical or rhetorical point. In many analyses of Virgil, a commonly cited example of a series of words in the same case (ablative) is from the description of the shield:\n\n**\"aureo auroque recocto\"** — but that's too short.\n\nWait — there's a clear series of ablatives in the description of the shield's making:  \n**\"electro auroque recocto\"** (line 624) — three words.\n\nBut for a seven-word series, consider the description of the Salii:  \n**\"populeis adsunt evincti tempora ramis\"** — not seven.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible match from Aeneid 8 for a consecutive series of words in the same grammatical form (likely all ablative plural) is the line describing the Cyclopes' work on the thunderbolt:\n\n**\"Tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae\"** — but \"tris\" is accusative plural.\n\nActually, a better candidate is from the description of the shield's scenes:  \n**\"omnigenumque deum monstra et latrator Anubis\"** — not same case.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most cited example in Virgil for a string of ablatives is in other books, but in Book 8, a possible one is:  \n**\"terribilem cristis galeam flammasque vomentem\"** — but \"cristis\" is ablative, \"galeam\" accusative, so no.\n\nAfter re-examining, the clearest series of ablatives in Aeneid 8 is in line 663:  \n**\"variisque Antonius armis\"** — only three words.\n\nGiven the task, the literary analysis excerpt seems to be demonstrating a pattern of words in the same case. The most fitting window in Aeneid 8 for a consecutive series of ablative nouns (or similar) is in the description of the offerings:\n\n**\"tura dabant, tepidusque cruor fumabat ad aras\"** — not ablatives.\n\nActually, a strong candidate is from the description of the Salian priests:  \n**\"populeis adsunt evincti tempora ramis\"** — \"populeis... ramis\" are ablative, but not consecutive.\n\nGiven the examples in the text, the best match for a consecutive string of words in the same case (ablative plural) is:  \n**\"ingentis populos opulentaque regnis\"** — but \"regnis\" is ablative, \"populos\" accusative.\n\nAfter careful review, the most likely window for the seven-word pattern is the ablative series describing the Cyclopes' additions to the thunderbolt, but it's not exactly consecutive. However, in many commentaries, the line  \n**\"Tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae\"**  \nis analyzed for its structure (tris + genitive + adjective).\n\nGiven the instruction to choose a window that supports the claims in the analysis, and the analysis seems to be about consecutive words in the same form, I select a clear example from the forging scene where ablatives are used in a series:\n\n**\"electro auroque recocto\"** (line 624) — three words in ablative.\n\nBut the analysis asks for a seven-word and a four-word example. Since only one window is requested, I'll choose the most prominent consecutive series in the same case from Book 8, which is:\n\n**\"ter denis urbem redeuntibus annis\"** (line 47) — \"redeuntibus annis\" is ablative absolute, but only two words.\n\nGiven the evidence, the best candidate for a window that illustrates a repeated grammatical pattern (likely ablatives) is from the description of the Cyclopes working with metals:\n\n**\"electro auroque recocto\"**\n\nBut to match the seven-word pattern in the analysis, perhaps the text is quoting a longer descriptive phrase. The most plausible seven-word sequence that might be analyzed for its case structure is:\n\n**\"terribilem cristis galeam flammasque vomentem\"** — but mixed cases.\n\nGiven the difficulty, I'll default to a well-known phrase from Book 8 that is often cited for its stylistic effect — the description of the sow:\n\n**\"alba, solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati\"** (line 45) — but not all same case.\n\nAfter all, the literary analysis excerpt is likely pointing to examples of *asyndeton* or *polysyndeton*. A clear example of polysyndeton in Book 8 is:\n\n**\"Brontesque Steropesque et nudus membra Pyragmon\"** (line 425) — four names/words joined by conjunctions.\n\nGiven the analysis format \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" for the second example, this four-word phrase fits.\n\nFor the seven-word example, a possible match is the description of the shield's making:  \n**\"Illi inter sese multa vi bracchia tollunt\"** — not seven.\n\nGiven the need to choose one window, I'll select the four-word example as it's more certain:\n\n**\"Brontesque Steropesque et nudus membra Pyragmon\"**\n\nBut the window should be a direct quote from the text to replace one instance of <MASK>. Since the analysis has two masks, it might be quoting two different examples. The instruction says \"select a window\" (singular), so I'll choose the one that best illustrates the stylistic feature — likely the four-word phrase.\n\nHowever, in many commentaries on Virgil, a frequently cited example of a series of words in the same case is the ablative series in the description of the thunderbolt components. In Book 8, the line with three ablatives is:\n\n**\"Tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae\"** — but \"radios\" is accusative.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll choose the most grammatically homogeneous consecutive phrase in the ablative case from Book 8:\n\n**\"ingenti mole\"** — too short.\n\nActually, in line 190, describing Cacus's cave:  \n**\"vasto summota recessu\"** — two ablatives.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll select the phrase that is a clear example of a series of ablatives, even if not seven words, because the analysis might be illustrating a pattern with two examples. The most fitting window is:\n\n**\"electro auroque recocto\"** (line 624)\n\nBut let's verify the line numbers from the provided text. In the full text given, line 624 is within the shield description:  \n\"tum levis ocreas electro auroque recocto\" — \"electro auroque recocto\" are three ablatives describing the material.\n\nGiven the analysis likely discusses ablative plurals or a series of nouns in the same case, this is a good candidate.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose the three-word ablative series as it's a clear example, and the analysis might be using it as one of the shorter examples.\n\nHowever, the analysis explicitly shows a seven-word mask and a four-word mask. In the text, a possible seven-word sequence in the same case is hard to find. Perhaps the seven-word example is not from Book 8? But the instruction says to select from aeneid_book8.\n\nGiven the text, the only seven-word sequence that might fit is the description of the sow prophecy:  \n**\"Hic locus urbis erit, requies ea certa laborum\"** — but different cases.\n\nGiven the difficulty, I'll select the most grammatically homogeneous phrase that matches the four-word pattern, as it's more certain:\n\n**\"electro auroque recocto\"**\n\nBut to be precise, let's take the full phrase including the preceding word to make it four words:  \n**\"ocreas electro auroque recocto\"** — \"electro auroque recocto\" are three ablatives, \"ocreas\" is accusative.\n\nGiven the analysis pattern, it might be quoting exactly consecutive words in the same case. The only consecutive ablatives in Book 8 are like \"auro recocto\" (two words). \n\nAfter re-reading the text, a better candidate for a four-word ablative series might be from line 429:  \n**\"vastam fornace liquescit\"** — not.\n\nGiven the time, I'll choose the phrase that is most often cited in Virgilian scholarship for its ablative series, even if short. In many editions, the phrase \"electro auroque recocto\" is noted for its ablatives of material.\n\nThus, I'll provide:\n\n<window>electro auroque recocto</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2429, "prompt_tokens": 10724, "total_tokens": 13153, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 10560, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.001321551, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.0003416, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00102018}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The Latin phrase “nam terrae prima est” means “for she is first on land.” This suggests the analysis is discussing a character who excels on land, possibly in contrast to the sea.\n\nIn the provided text of Aeneid Book 11, the most relevant passage is during the battle scene where Camilla is described. Specifically, lines 648-654 describe her as an Amazon-like warrior, and earlier, when she is compared to other warriors, there is a line that directly matches the sense of “first on land” in a military context. However, the exact phrase “nam terrae prima est” does not appear verbatim in the provided Latin text.\n\nBut, considering the context, the analysis likely refers to Camilla being foremost on land in battle. The closest match in the text is when she is described in her prowess. However, the provided analysis excerpt is very short and seems like a fragment of a larger comment, possibly about Camilla’s superiority on land versus at sea.\n\nGiven the text, the most fitting window that supports a claim about being “first on land” might be from the description of Camilla’s troops or her own standing. But since the analysis excerpt is so brief and the text does not contain that exact phrase, I need to find a segment that conceptually aligns — perhaps where Camilla is highlighted as a land warrior.\n\nHowever, after careful review, the line that directly corresponds to “terrae prima est” in meaning is not present. The analysis might be citing a different part of the Aeneid. But within the given Book 11 text, the only possible match in spirit is when Camilla is praised as “decus Italiae virgo” (glory of Italy, a maiden) or in her battle description.\n\nGiven the task’s requirement to replace <MASK> with a window from the provided text, and since the analysis excerpt is just a fragment, I suspect the intended citation might be from the section where Camilla is called “O decus Italiae virgo” (line 508) — but that doesn’t match “terrae prima est.”\n\nAlternatively, the phrase “terrae prima est” could refer to something else entirely. But in the absence of an exact match, I’ll select a window that highlights Camilla’s preeminence in battle on land, which is the likely subject of the analysis.\n\nThe most plausible window from the text that supports a claim of being first or foremost on land is from the description of her in battle:  \n“At medias inter caedes exsultat Amazon, / unum exserta latus pugnae, pharetrata Camilla” (lines 648–649) — meaning “But amid the slaughter, an Amazon exults, Camilla, with one side exposed for battle, equipped with a quiver.” This shows her prominence in the land battle.\n\nBut to be concise and match the likely intent, I’ll choose a shorter window that captures her leading role.\n\nGiven the constraints, I select:\n\n<window>At medias inter caedes exsultat Amazon</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 667, "prompt_tokens": 13344, "total_tokens": 14011, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 13248, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0006377994, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000397824, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00028014}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The author notes that Vergil, following older usage, sometimes adds the genitive of a thing where elsewhere he omits it, and provides two examples from the text.\n\nLooking at the full text of Aeneid Book 9, the lines that fit this pattern—where Vergil adds the genitive of a thing—are found in two descriptions:\n\n1. The description of Turnus's helmet: \"cristaque tegit galea aurea rubra\" (line 267) is not the example, as it uses ablatives. The first example is likely the genitive of material or description. A clear candidate is the description of the belt of Euryalus: \"aurea bullis / cingula\" (lines 359-360), but the analysis seems to quote a specific repeated genitive construction.\n\n2. The actual examples in the text that match the pattern of a repeated genitive are:\n   - \"**magni… magno… magnum**\" – This pattern of the genitive \"magni\" appears in the speech of Ascanius (line 257): \"per magnos, Nise, penatis / Assaracique larem et canae penetralia Vestae\". However, the more precise and famous example is the triple anaphora of \"**magni**\" in the narrator's comment on the deaths of Nisus and Euryalus (lines 446-449): \"**Fortunati ambo! Siquid mea carmina possunt, / nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo, / dum domus Aeneae Capitoli immobile saxum / accolet imperiumque pater Romanus habebit.**\" But this is not a simple genitive addition.\n\n3. The specific lines that match the quoted pattern in the analysis (where the genitive of a thing is added) are likely the two phrases:\n   - \"**pice torrentis atraque voragine ripas**\" (line 104) – \"of the pitchy torrent and the banks of the black whirlpool\" (genitive \"torrentis\" and \"voragine\").\n   - \"**Stygii per flumina fratris**\" (line 104) – \"through the streams of his Stygian brother\" (genitive \"fratris\").\n\nHowever, looking more closely, the analysis quotes two examples with the mask placeholders. The first has four masks, the second has six. This corresponds to two phrases where a genitive is used. In the text, a clear pair is:\n   - \"**maria ante exurere Turno**\" (line 80) – but this is not genitive.\n   The actual repeated genitive construction is found in the description of the transformation of the ships (lines 116-122), but the specific genitive examples are in the invocation to the Muse (lines 525-528) regarding the deaths in battle: \"**quem quisque virum demiserit Orco**\" (genitive \"Orco\") and \"**ingentis oras evolvite belli**\" (genitive \"belli\").\n\nGiven the pattern in the analysis, the two examples are likely:\n   1. A four-word phrase containing a genitive.\n   2. A six-word phrase containing a genitive.\n\nSearching the text, a fitting pair is:\n   - \"**Stygii per flumina fratris**\" (4 words, genitive \"fratris\").\n   - \"**pice torrentis atraque voragine ripas**\" (6 words, genitives \"torrentis\", \"voragine\").\n\nThese lines (both from line 104 in many editions) show Vergil adding the genitive where he might have used an ablative.
