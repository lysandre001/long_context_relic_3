Looking at the context, it seems to be discussing grammatical constructions, specifically comparing uses of genitive and ablative cases.\n\nLet me search for relevant passages. The key phrase in the analysis is \"cuius rei\" (of which thing/matter), suggesting we're looking for a genitive construction.\n\nLooking through the text, I find several potential candidates. The analysis mentions that the author \"added\" something (\"addidit\") in contrast to places where he \"subtracted\" (\"subtraxerit\").\n\nA relevant passage appears to be:\n\"Hic Mars armipotens animum viresque Latinis addidit\"\n\nThis contains \"addidit\" which matches the literary analysis's discussion. The phrase \"animum viresque\" (spirit and strength) uses the accusative case as direct objects.\n\nHowever, the analysis is specifically about genitive vs ablative usage. Let me look more carefully.\n\nThe phrase \"cuius rei\" in the analysis suggests we need to find where a genitive of \"res\" (thing/matter) is used. \n\nLooking at the text, I find: \"quod cuique tuendum est\" - but this doesn't quite fit.\n\nActually, examining more closely, I see \"certorum rerum\" type constructions aren't prominent. But there's \"rerum\" appearing in contexts like \"regni de rebus\" and \"quaeretur gloria rebus.\"\n\nGiven the context about adding vs subtracting, and the reference to \"cuius rei,\" the most likely window is:\n\n<window>cuius rei</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 13293, "total_tokens": 13696, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04546476, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.039879, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.006045}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

This makes it difficult to determine what specific window would fit.\n\nLooking at common scholarly discussions of the Aeneid, phrases that are often analyzed include the opening \"Arma virumque cano\" or key thematic phrases. Given the \"id est quomodo\" construction suggests an explanation of method or manner, a likely candidate would be a phrase describing how something is done.\n\nThe most reasonable interpretation is that this is explaining a phrase, and \"quo numine laeso\" (by what divine will having been injured) fits as it's a question of \"how\" or \"by what means.\"\n\n<window>quo numine laeso</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 12437, "total_tokens": 12784, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04209084, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.037311, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005205}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
