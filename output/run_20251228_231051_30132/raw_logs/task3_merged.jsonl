The missing quotation is from Ennius, not from Vergil's Aeneid. However, the analysis cites \"aeneid_book7\" and the quotation is represented by `<MASK>`. This suggests the analysis is discussing a line in Aeneid Book 7 that Vergil adapted from Ennius, and the quotation is the Ennian original.\n\nIn Aeneid 7, there is a famous borrowing from Ennius's *Annales*: the line \"**olli respondit suavis sonus Egeriai**\" (or similar). In Vergil, this becomes \"**tum satus Anchisa delectos ordine ab omni**\" (line 152) or another line? Actually, the borrowing is in the description of the consultation of the oracle of Faunus. In Ennius, King Numa consults Egeria; in Vergil, Latinus consults Faunus. The specific Ennian line is \"**olli respondit suavis sonus Egeriai**\" (Annales fr. 113 Skutsch).  \n\nBut the literary analysis says Vergil made an \"acyrologiam\" by changing Ennius's verse. The likely Vergilian line that adapts Ennius is Aeneid 7.81–83, where Latinus consults the oracle of Faunus. However, the quotation in the analysis is the Ennian line, which is not in the Aeneid text.  \n\nGiven the task: \"identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in aeneid_book7\" — the missing quotation is the Ennian line, but it does not appear verbatim in Aeneid 7. However, the analysis cites aeneid_book7 and the quotation is masked, so perhaps the analysis is quoting Vergil's line that alludes to Ennius, and we need to find where that Vergilian line is in Book 7.\n\nThe most likely candidate is the line where Vergil echoes Ennius's description of an oracle response. In Aeneid 7, lines 81–101 describe Latinus consulting Faunus. The direct speech of the oracle starts at line 96. But the line that directly recalls Ennius might be line 83: \"**consulit Albunea, nemorum quae maxima sacro**\" or line 95: \"**velleribus: subita ex alto vox reddita luco est**\".  \n\nGiven the phrasing \"olli respondit\" in Ennius, Vergil's equivalent is \"**subita ex alto vox reddita luco est**\" (line 95). That is the line where the oracle responds.  \n\nThus, the missing quotation in the analysis is likely the Ennian line, but the corresponding line in Aeneid 7 where Vergil adapts it is line 95.  \n\nTherefore, the answer is line 95.\n\n<line>95</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 653, "prompt_tokens": 13105, "total_tokens": 13758, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0031130352, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00293552, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00020896}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The text around it is in Latin:  \n*obtineat , custodiat , inhabitet , ut “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK“ .*\n\nThis suggests the missing quotation is a Latin phrase introduced by *ut* (“so that”).  \nIn *Aeneid* Book 6, a famous passage containing a list of seven imperative verbs (fitting seven masks) is in lines 851–853, where Anchises tells Aeneas the future mission of Rome:\n\n> “tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;  \n> hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque imponere morem,  \n> parcere subiectis, et debellare superbos.”\n\nBut that’s only four verbs (*regere, imponere, parcere, debellare*), not seven.  \n\nHowever, the line often cited in similar literary analyses about Rome’s mission is **line 851** alone:  \n*“tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento”* — but that’s not seven words.\n\nGiven the seven masks and the structure *ut* + quotation, I suspect the quotation is **lines 851–853** treated as a single quoted block, but the seven masks correspond to the seven key words in the famous part of that passage: *regere, imperio, populos, Romane, memento* (5 words) — not seven.  \n\nAlternatively, another possibility is the Sibyl’s prophecy earlier: *“bella, horrida bella, / et Thybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno”* (lines 86–87), but that’s not seven words either.\n\nGiven the task’s likely reference to the most famous line of Book 6 for Rome’s destiny, and since the literary analysis excerpt seems to be about Rome’s duties (obtineat, custodiat, inhabitet — “may he hold, guard, dwell in”), the missing quotation is likely the seven-word Latin phrase from Anchises’ speech.  \n\nThe exact seven-word sequence in Virgil is:  \n**“tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento”** (line 851) — that’s 6 words in Latin (*tu, regere, imperio, populos, Romane, memento*), but sometimes *Romane* is split as *Romane* (vocative) counted separately? Actually, it’s 6 words.  \n\nBut the seven masks could match the seven-word phrase if we take *“pacisque imponere morem”* (line 852) as part of it, but that’s more than seven words total.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most likely single line cited is **851**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<line>851</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 624, "prompt_tokens": 14738, "total_tokens": 15362, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 14592, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0006676488, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.000449456, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00026208}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The first is shorter (4 masks), the second longer (6 masks).  \nGiven the context, these are likely examples of the genitive of description (or similar construction) from Book 9.\n\nSearching through the provided text of Book 9, I find two clear instances where a repeated genitive phrase occurs:\n\n1. **Lines 179–180**:  \n   `ora puer prima signans intonsa iuventa` — not a repeated genitive.\n\n2. **Lines 269–270**:  \n   `vidisti quo Turnus equo, quibus ibat in armis / aureus` — not repeated genitive.\n\n3. **Lines 446–449**:  \n   `Fortunati ambo!

No.\n\nLet’s search for a phrase where multiple consecutive words are in the genitive case.  \nIn **line 179**: `ora puer prima signans intonsa iuventa` — `intonsa iuventa` is ablative.\n\nBut in **lines 269–270**: `quo Turnus equo, quibus ibat in armis / aureus` — not genitive.\n\nActually, the repeated genitive example often cited from Book 9 is **\"magnanimum Aenean et fata extrema secutus\"** (line 204) — not repeated genitive.\n\nBetter: Look for `-orum` or `-arum` repeated.  \nIn **line 330**: `tris iuxta famulos temere inter tela iacentis` — `tela iacentis` not repeated genitive.\n\nBut in **lines 330–331**: `armigerumque Remi` — `Remi` is genitive, but only one.\n\nThe only clear repeated genitive in Book 9 is in **lines 269–270**? No.\n\nWait — maybe the examples are not from Book 9? But the literary analysis says “hic secutus veteres cuius rei MASK addidit, cum alibi subtraxerit” — meaning here he added the genitive, whereas elsewhere he omitted it, and then gives two examples from Book 9 where the genitive is used.\n\nThe likely repeated genitive phrase in Book 9 is **\"Euryali et Nisi\"** (line 467) — but that’s just two names in genitive.\n\nBut the first `<MASK>` has 4 masks, second has 6 masks.  \nIf each mask = one word, then first quote = 4 words in genitive, second = 6 words in genitive.\n\nSearching for 4 consecutive genitive words in Book 9:  \n**Line 179**: `ora puer prima signans` — no.  \n**Line 330**: `tris iuxta famulos temere` — no.\n\nActually, in **lines 330–331**: `armigerumque Remi` — only 2 genitive words.\n\nBut in **lines 446–447**: `memori vos eximet aevo` — ablative.\n\nMaybe the repeated genitive is in **lines 269–270**? `aureus` — no.\n\nLet’s check **lines 179–180** again: `ora puer prima signans intonsa iuventa` — `intonsa iuventa` = ablative.\n\nBut the famous one is **\"magnanimum Aenean et fata extrema secutus\"** (line 204) — not repeated genitive.\n\nI think the repeated genitive in question is **\"Euryali et Nisi\"** (line 467) — but that’s only 2 genitive words.\n\nMaybe the examples are not from Book 9? But the literary analysis cites *Aeneid* Book 9.\n\nGiven the difficulty, I’ll look for a phrase where multiple consecutive words end in genitive plural `-orum` or `-arum`.  \nIn **line 330**: `tris iuxta famulos temere inter tela iacentis` — `tela iacentis` = genitive? No, `iacentis` is genitive singular.\n\nActually, `tela iacentis` = genitive singular of `iacens` modifying `tela`? No, `tela` is plural accusative, `iacentis` is genitive singular — not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I’ll note that a known grammatical comment on Virgil’s *Aeneid* Book 9 concerns the genitive of description in **line 179** (`ora puer prima signans intonsa iuventa` — `intonsa iuventa` is ablative, though) and **line 269** (`quo Turnus equo, quibus ibat in armis / aureus` — `equo` ablative).\n\nBut the literary analysis says he *added* the genitive here, whereas elsewhere he omitted it.  \nThe likely place is where Virgil uses a genitive where other authors might use an ablative.  \nThat occurs in **line 179** with `intonsa iuventa`? No, that’s ablative.\n\nActually, in **line 179**, some manuscripts read `intonsa iuventa` as ablative, but maybe the comment is about a different passage.\n\nGiven the phrasing in the literary analysis, it might be referring to **lines 179–180** and **lines 269–270**, but those are not repeated genitives.\n\nGiven the instruction, if the quotation spans multiple lines, provide the starting line number.  \nThe first example in the analysis is 4 masks (4 words), second is 6 masks (6 words).  \nSearching for 4 consecutive genitive words in Book 9:  \n**Line 330** has `tris iuxta famulos temere` — no.  \n**Line 331** has `armigerumque Remi premit aurigamque` — `Remi` is genitive, but only one.\n\nGiven the difficulty, I’ll guess the first example is from **line 179** (`ora puer prima signans`) — but that’s not genitive.\n\nWait — maybe the examples are:  \n1. `ora puer prima signans` (line 179) — 4 words, but not genitive.  \n2. `quo Turnus equo quibus ibat in armis` (lines 269–270) — 6 words, but not genitive.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I’ll choose the most famous repeated genitive in Book 9, which is in **line 467** (`Euryali et Nisi`), but that’s only 2 words.\n\nGiven the literary analysis is about the genitive case, and a known example from Book 9 is **line 179** (`intonsa iuventa` — ablative, though), I’ll go with **line 179** as the starting line for the first quotation.\n\nBut the analysis says “hic secutus veteres cuius rei MASK addidit” — meaning here he followed the ancients in adding the genitive of the thing.  \nThat could be **line 179** where `iuventa` is genitive in some readings? Actually, `iuventa` is ablative here.\n\nGiven the time, I’ll conclude the first quotation starts at **line 179**.\n\n<line>179</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2003, "prompt_tokens": 13208, "total_tokens": 15211, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.004494105, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00369824, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00084126}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The phrase “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” is likely a Latin quotation from the text, and the analysis then says: “et hoc secundum naturam est, nam 'MASK MASK MASK' dicimus : per dativum enim figuratum est.”  \n\nThe second masked part (“MASK MASK MASK”) seems to be a shorter quotation illustrating the dative case.  \n\nSearching through the provided text of Aeneid Book 7, a likely candidate for such a grammatical example is line 231–232:  \n\n> **Non erimus regno indecores, nec vestra feretur**  \n> **fama levis tantique abolescet gratia facti**  \n\nBut that doesn’t match the “per dativum enim figuratum est” clue.  \n\nA more probable match is a line where a dative is used in a notable way. In lines 195–196, we have:  \n\n> **“Dicite, Dardanidae (neque enim nescimus et urbem**  \n> **et genus, auditique advertitis aequore cursum),”**  \n\nBut that’s not a short 3-word phrase.  \n\nHowever, the analysis seems to be citing an example of accusative usage first (the 6-mask part), then a shorter example of dative usage (the 3-mask part).  \n\nIn Vergil, a common example of the dative of purpose or dative of reference is **“magno misceri murmure caelum”** (from Aeneid 1), but that’s not in Book 7.  \n\nWithin Book 7, a possible accusative example is **“classem invectas Thybridis undam”** (line 436), but the analysis’s structure suggests the quotation is illustrating a grammatical point, not just narrative.  \n\nGiven the clues, the most likely match in Book 7 for a short dative phrase is **“fatis debita”** or similar, but let’s check line 120:  \n\n> **“Salve fatis mihi debita tellus”**  \n\nHere “fatis” is dative (“owed to the fates”). That’s a 3-word phrase in Latin if we take **“fatis debita tellus”**? Actually “fatis mihi debita tellus” is 4 words.  \n\nBut the analysis says: “nam 'MASK MASK MASK' dicimus : per dativum enim figuratum est.” That could be **“fatis debita tellus”** (if we drop “mihi”) or just **“fatis debita”** (dative of agent with debita).  \n\nLooking at the text, line 120 is:  \n\n> **“Salve fatis mihi debita tellus”**  \n\nThe dative “fatis” is clear. This is a likely candidate for the 3-mask quotation in the analysis.  \n\nThus, the 6-mask accusative example before it might be from earlier in the same speech or nearby. Possibly lines 122–123:  \n\n> **“hic domus, haec patria est. Genitor mihi talia namque**  \n> **(nunc repeto) Anchises fatorum arcana reliquit:”**  \n\nBut that’s not exactly 6 words.  \n\nGiven the task, the line number for the **dative example** (“fatis debita”) is line 120.

However, the analysis likely cites a description of a character or action that is \"cruel and bloody.\" Given the context of Book 10, which is full of battle violence, the closest match in wording and theme is likely from a speech or narration involving Mezentius or Turnus.\n\nA key moment that fits the theme of cruelty and bloodshed is when Turnus kills Pallas and takes his belt as a spoil (lines 490-500). The language there is vivid and brutal, but the exact words \"crudelem, cruentum\" are not present.\n\nSince the provided text is the full Latin text, and the phrase \"crudelem , cruentum .\" is not found, it's possible the analysis is quoting a commentator's summary phrase rather than a direct line from Virgil. However, if we must locate the nearest thematic match, a likely candidate is the description of Mezentius as \"saevus\" or the battle's cruelty.\n\nBut given the instruction to identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in the text, and since the quotation is not present verbatim, the most reasonable conclusion is that the quotation is not in Book 10. However, the task assumes it is directly cited from Book 10.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will note that no exact match exists. But if forced to choose a line that embodies \"cruel, bloody,\" a strong candidate is line 908, which describes Mezentius's death: \"undantique animam diffundit in arva cruore\" — \"and pours forth his life on the fields in a wave of blood.\" The word \"cruore\" (blood) connects to \"cruentum.\"\n\nBut since the exact phrase \"crudelem, cruentum\" is not there, I cannot provide a line number with certainty. However, following the instruction to provide the starting line number if it spans multiple lines, and based on the most bloody and cruel action (the death of Pallas and Turnus's taunt), the lines around 490-495 are thematically closest.\n\nGiven the lack of exact match, I will default to the line that contains the word \"cruentum\" or \"crudelis\" in some form. Searching the text:\n\n- \"crudeli\" appears in line 386 (\"crudeli morte\").\n- \"cruenta\" appears in line 341 (\"cruenta tenorem\").\n- \"cruento\" appears in line 489 (\"ore cruento\").\n\nNone match the phrase exactly.
