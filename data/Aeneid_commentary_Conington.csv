85646649,aeneid_book1,Conington,"This line is preceded in some MSS. by the following verses, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” They are not found in Med., Rom., Gud., or the Verona fragments (Pal. and the fragments of Vat. and St. Gall seem to fail here), and the only MS. in Ribbeck's list which contains them (the Berne MS. No. 172) has them written in the margin by a later hand. They appear to have existed in the time of Servius and of the Pseudo-Donatus, who say that Nisus the grammarian had heard a story of their having been expunged by Tueca and Varius; on which Heyne remarks, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The external evidence of such a story it is impossible to estimate, but its existence suspiciously indicates that the lines were felt to require apology. Those who speak of them as an introduction to the poem, forget that if genuine they are an integral part of the first sentence; and that it is, to say the least, remarkable that the exordium should be so constructed as to be at once interwoven with the context, and yet capable of removal without detriment to the construction, just at the point which forms a much better commencement. The words ‘MASK MASK’ are quoted by Martial, 8. 56., 19. 14., 185. 2, and Auson. Epig. 137. 1, evidently as a real commencement of the Aeneid; while Ovid, Trist. 2. 533, and Persius, 1. 96, quote ‘MASK MASK MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK MASK’ as important and independent words, which they cease to be the moment ‘MASK’ is viewed in connexion with the words supposed to precede it. Virg. himself, 9. 777, has (of the poet Clytins) “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Comp. also MASK , Prop. 3. 26. 63, which point the same way. Macrob. Sat. 5. 2. quotes ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as part of the first verse of the Aeneid. On the other hand Priscian 910 P cites ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as Virg.'s. Henry's view that ‘MASK MASK’ is happily contrasted with ‘MASK MASK’ (comp. MASK ) seems to be favoured by the structure of the sentence, and may very possibly have been present to the mind of the author of these lines; but it clearly was not present to the minds of those who quoted ‘MASK’ by itself as war . Tastes may differ as to the rival commencements, on which see Henry in loco, and on 2. 247; but it may be suggested that Virg. would scarcely in his first sentence have divided the attention of the reader between himself and his hero by saying, in effect, that the poet who wrote the Eclogues and the Georgics, sings the hero who founded Rome . Wagn. and Forb., however, as well as Henry, consider the lines as genuine; and they have been imitated by Spenser in the opening of the Faery Queene, and Milton in the opening of Paradise Regained.","Arma virumque cano , Troiae qui primus ab oris",1,1,,,
22332717,aeneid_book1,Conington,"this is an imitation of the opening of the Odyssey, MASK MASK MASK MASK . MASK . MASK . It may also be taken from the first line of the Cyclic poem of the Epigoni, preserved by the Schol. on MASK , MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK . It is followed by all the other Roman writers of epic poetry, Lucan, Flaccus, Statius, and, above all, Silius, the most faithful copier of Virg., with a unanimity which strongly supports the view taken in the preceding note. The words are not a hendiadys, but give first the character of the subject and then the subject itself. ‘MASK’ may have been intended to suggest, though it does not express, a contrast between this and Virg.'s previous poems.—In commencing with ‘MASK’ he has followed his own example in the Georgics, rather than that of Homer, who at once invokes the Muse; and the Latin Epic writers have followed Virg. The earlier commentators have found a difficulty in reconciling ‘MASK’ with Antenor's previous migration (below, vv. 242 foll.), and suggest that Aeneas had first reached Italy proper, though Antenor had previously reached Venetia. On the other hand, Heyne and Wagn. make ‘MASK’ equivalent to ‘MASK MASK’ thus weakening a word which from its position and its occurrence in the first line of the poem must be emphatic. The more obvious sense is that Aeneas is so called without reference to Antenor, as the founder of the great Trojan empire in Italy.",Arma virumque,1,1,,,

Perhaps the force may be “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” a glorious and heaven-sent fugitive. So MASK , comp. by Weidner, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” For the poetic accus. ‘MASK MASK’ without the preposition, see Madv. § 232, obs. 4. The MSS. are divided between ‘MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ and perhaps ‘MASK MASK’ The last, however, though adopted by Burm. and Heyne, and approved by Heins., seems to rest solely on the authority of Med., which has ‘MASK’ (corrected into ‘MASK’), with a mark of erasure after the word. ‘MASK’ is found in the Verona fragm., and is supported by quotations in Terentianus Maurus and Diomedes, and in single MSS. of Priscian, Censorinus, and Servius in artem Donati. ‘MASK’ is found in Rom., Gud., and probably most other MSS., and is supported by quotations in Macrobius, Gellius, Marius Victorinus, Pompeius, the Schol. on Lucan, most MSS. of Priscian, and one of Censorinus. Servius mentions both readings, saying, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ is supported by 4. 236: but the synizesis, though not unexampled (comp. 5. 269., 6. 33, and see on MASK ), is perhaps awkward, especially in the second line of the poem, and the imitation in Prop. 3. 26. 64, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” is in favour of the form ‘MASK’ Juv. 12. 71 has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” though there as in Prop. the quadrisyllabic form might be introduced and explained by synizesis. On the whole, I have preferred ‘MASK’ believing the form to be possible in itself (comp. “MASK MASK” “MASK MASK” “MASK” &c.), and more probable in this instance; the modern editors however are generally for ‘MASK MASK’ Lachmann on MASK speaks doubtfully. The epithet which belonged to the place after the foundation of the city by Aeneas is given to it here, as in 4. 236, by a natural anticipation at the time of his landing.",Fato,2,1,,,

Others make ‘MASK’ nearly equivalent to ‘MASK MASK’ citing 2. 123, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but even supposing that ‘MASK’ in this sense might be taken distributively, which the passage above quoted does not prove, ‘MASK’ would scarcely be appropriate to ‘MASK’ in this sense, while the words frequently occur in conjunction in the sense of outraged majesty. Comp. 2. 183, Hor. Epod. 15. 3, and Macleane's note. Heyne accepts Serv.'s proposal of separating ‘MASK’ from ‘MASK MASK’ and taking it in the sense of “MASK MASK MASK” “MASK MASK MASK” which would be extremely harsh. It remains then, with Wagn., to regard the expression as equivalent to “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” referring it to the cases already noticed on MASK , where the pronoun or pronominal adjective stands for its corresponding adverb. Thus the negative answer to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ would be “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Or we may say that ‘MASK MASK’ alone would stand for “MASK MASK” (see Madv. § 426), and that in such a construction the question could hardly be asked otherwise than by making the interrogative pronoun agree with the noun.

It is only in the sense of the affront that it can properly be joined with ‘MASK MASK MASK’ understood of being forgotten. So “MASK MASK” v. 9.

Henry's interpretation, making ‘MASK’ abl., and supposing Ajax to be pierced by a fragment of rock hurled at him (‘MASK’ being paralleled with “MASK MASK MASK MASK” 12. 531), agrees to a certain extent with Quinct.

Again, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is not the same thing as “MASK MASK MASK MASK” The more reasonable thing seems to be to say that Virg. uses imagery principally taken from the race-horse and the prison, but without intending any one connected or uniform series of metaphors.

Henry once thought it was an eminence within the cave; now he takes it of a fortress or palace in the neighbourhood. This last certainly seems the most natural meaning of the word. The citadel is the natural dwelling of a despotic governor (comp. Juv. 10. 307); in Greek history, tyrants seize it when they assume supreme power; and so here, as Aeolia is under a strong government, it is supposed to be furnished with an ‘MASK MASK’ though the government consists in keeping the key of the prison.

It is in this ‘MASK’ that Juno has her interview with MASK, who goes from it (though this is not directly asserted) to the dungeon, and opens the door. ‘MASK’ expresses actual sitting, not, as Henry thinks, merely dwelling; but it has no further appropriateness than as carrying out the image of ‘MASK MASK’ and so ‘MASK MASK MASK’ the Homeric MASK .",circum claustra fremunt ; celsa sedet Aeolus arce,56,1,,,

The expression seems to denote the difficulty of a coasting voyage, such as Antenor would make up the east of the Adriatic, whether arising from the dangerous nature of the coast itself, or from the barbarity of the inhabitants. ‘MASK MASK’ may be either the Adriatic, as washing the shore of Illyricum, or the indentations in the Illyrican coast. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is not so much the interior of the Liburnian territory, which Antenor coming by sea would not penetrate, as the kingdom lying far inward in the Adriatic. ‘MASK’ is said to be a nautical word by Serv., who quotes from Lucilius “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Here and MASK , where it is also applied to the Timavus, it probably denotes difficulty.

Between this and the sea (a distance of about a mile) there are subterranean communications, through which the salt water forces its way, breaking out at the fountain through seven mouths or holes in the limestone rock, and overflowing the channel of the river. See the account quoted by Henry from Cluverius, Ital. Antiq. 1. 20, and more recent descriptions cited in the same note from Wittmann and Schlözer.

Polybius asserts that the water in all but one of these ‘MASK’ is salt, which Strabo denies. The two are reconciled by Cluverius, who reports from actual observation that the sea occasionally bursts up through six of the sources, and renders the water undrinkable. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ refers to the sound of the water re-echoing through the limestone rock as it bursts up; ‘MASK MASK MASK’ to its sound after bursting up. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” v. 55 note. ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ comp. 7. 459, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Gud. originally and fragm.

The language undoubtedly is such as is more generally applied to death or sleep, but the occurrence of such expressions as “MASK MASK” (7. 339., 12. 822), or “MASK” (10. 15), “MASK MASK MASK” (12. 109), and “MASK MASK MASK MASK” (3. 387), proves abundantly that the words ‘MASK MASK’ may well have been used of the repose of a peaceful life.

The latter particular is an ornamental one, and need not be understood as if the steps were of brass also. Brazen thresholds are Homeric, e. g. Od. 7. 89, of the palace of Alcinous, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , a passage which may have been in Virg.'s mind. The next clause presents a greater difficulty. All the first-class MSS. seem to have ‘MASK’ (Wagn. excepts fragm. Vat., but Ribbeck is silent); ‘MASK’ is mentioned by Serv., found in some MSS., and adopted by Wagn. (ed. mi.), Forb., Henry, Ladewig, and Haupt. The external authority is quite sufficient to support the change, which is itself a very natural one (see on 4. 217., 5. 279, MASK ); but its advocates are not agreed on the sense. Henry and Forb. take ‘MASK’ of the beams of the roof, which rest on brazen columns. Wagn. makes ‘MASK’ the doorposts, and understands ‘MASK MASK’ in the sense of “MASK MASK MASK MASK” simply a periphrasis for ‘MASK’ Ladewig makes ‘MASK’ the architrave, which rests on pillars or jambs of brass. Of these the third seems the only one that can stand, the first being objectionable as introducing a particular about the rest of the building between two particulars about the door; the second as giving a forced and unnatural sense to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ Understanding ‘MASK’ with Wagn. of the doorposts, I believe ‘MASK MASK’ stands for “MASK” as “MASK” or “MASK” might have done, the word being employed, not only to express the coherence of the plating with the thing plated, but to indicate the coherence of the posts with the threshold and the lintel, much as in MASK (which Wund. comp.)

Serv., in explaining the difference between ‘MASK’ and “MASK MASK” says that “MASK” is “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which probably shows that he read ‘MASK’ here, especially as he goes on to speak of the gender of ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK’ will then have nothing to do with the office of “MASK MASK” the arranger of the dishes, as Taubmann supposes, but will be i. q. “MASK MASK” to furnish or replenish; these ‘MASK’ being evidently distinguished from the two hundred who serve the banquet. ‘MASK’ may be a translation of Hom.'s MASK MASK in the parallel passage, Od. 7. 104; but it more probably has reference to the “MASK MASK MASK” as opposed to the hall in which the guests were served. ‘MASK’ refers not to ‘MASK MASK’ but to the division or course of labour among the servants, as in MASK , A. 5. 102. ‘MASK’ was retained by Heinsius and Heyne, and is still preferred by Gossrau and Henry; but ‘MASK’ was restored by Wagn., and is generally read by the later editors. ‘MASK MASK’ is of course common enough in Virg.; but this would be the very reason for its introduction here by a transcriber. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ seems to express merely the keeping up of the fire for cooking.

Euphorion apud Serv. agrees mainly with Virg., except that Laocoon's real offence is said to have been a forbidden marriage; and so Hyginus, who treats the notion of any other crime as a delusion of the Trojans. Heyne thinks it probable that Virg. may expressly have copied Euphorion, whom he is known to have admired (see MASK ., 10. 50). Of Sophocles' tragedy of Laocoon but very few fragments have been preserved: from one of them however (fr. 343, Nauck) it appears that his story must have differed from Virg.'s, as the flight of Aeneas with his father and a body of Trojan emigrants is distinctly mentioned, so that the hero of the play can hardly have died before the taking of the city. Serv. has a strange notice of Bacchylides, who, he says, speaks of Laocoon and his wife, or the serpents which came from the Calydnae islands and were turned into men (“MASK MASK MASK” might conceivably mean ‘MASK MASK’); but the passage may be corrupt.

On the whole however it seems more likely that Aeneas, who has as yet seen no one, should ask first a general question about the safety of the city, and then a special one about the citadel, so that after much hesitation I follow Henry in returning to the common view. “MASK” is used in its proper sense, a citadel, or point of defence, though ‘MASK’ seems to show that the word is not meant to be restricted to the citadel MASK MASK , Pergamus, as Wagn.'s interpretation of ‘MASK’ for “MASK” would not yield an appropriate sense.

He is mentioned by Euripides (?), Rhes. 539. Euphorion (see on v. 199) represented him as a fool, probably to give individuality to the character, as later writers perverted the Homeric conceptions of Menelaus, Ulysses, &c.; and this view became traditional, Zenobius making him a sort of gigantic idiot who would stand counting the waves of the sea, Aristides (Platon. 2) contrasting him and Palamades as the two extremes, and Aelian (Var. Hist. 13. 15) enumerating him among extraordinary fools. Cerda, who has collected these authorities, also mentions a proverb, MASK MASK .

A former pointing was ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which is supported by the fact that in other passages of the kind where ‘MASK’ is constructed with a gen., the gen. comes after ‘MASK’ (comp. 1. 497., 11. 478): but ‘MASK’ with the gen. elsewhere in Virg. appears to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK’","Primus se , Danaum magna comitante caterva",370,1,,,

The difficulty is that the same spelling is not preserved throughout, as almost all the MSS. read ‘MASK’ v. 392, and Charisius (1. 15, p. 92, Keil) agrees with them, though in 6. 20 he declares that Virg. wrote ‘MASK’ which seems now to be found only in some cursive MSS. In v. 425 the great majority and Charisius have “MASK” not “MASK” In 5. 265 Med. has “MASK” Rom. and Pal. “MASK MASK” which is recognized by Quinctilian 8. 4. 24. The MSS. are constantly varying in the spelling of proper names, and it does not seem probable that Virg. would designedly have alternated between two forms of the same word within a few lines of each other, nor yet that a bonâ fide tradition of his variety of practice in this respect can have come down to the grammarians. Reason would seem in favour of ‘MASK’ ‘MASK’ as the Greek form would be MASK or MASK , like MASK or MASK , and the Romans do not turn MASK into ‘MASK’ while if they had preferred the latter form they would have had to lengthen the penultimate by adopting the diphthong. If ‘MASK’ is to be defended, we must suppose that Virg., wishing to avoid the Greek form, especially in an oblique case, chose to Latinize an imaginary third form, MASK . Meanwhile it seems safest to decide for ‘MASK’ here on the analogy of ‘MASK MASK’ which will also avoid the necessity of supposing a caesura, and in vv. 392, 425 to follow the great multitude of MSS. “MASK MASK” v. 613 below.","Androgeos offert nobis , socia agmina credens",371,1,,,

The use of the nom. with “MASK MASK” as in Hor. 3 Od. 27. 73, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” is not to be confounded with it, as there an attraction does take place, or rather perhaps a confusion between the two modes of expression.

This agrees with ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as explained above, and gives a force to the whole context which it would not otherwise possess, the fate of the disguised Trojans being treated as a visitation from the gods for presuming on their aid, or attempting to gain it when it was not to be given. If Serv.'s explanation of v. 396 could be substantiated, the meaning would be more definite; but the passage does not require such a hypothesis. We should bear in mind the prominence given throughout this book to the agency of the gods; the Trojans are blinded by the gods so as to take in the horse: Aeneas rushes out in desperation on hearing that the gods have declared against Troy , v. 336; his very words to his companions, vv. 350 foll., contrast ominously with those of Coroebus, v. 387, the one bidding them accept the doom of the vanquished, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” the other urging them to avail themselves of the first omen of safety and convert it into a certainty.

Henry refers to a similar comparison MASK Sil. 12. 6 foll. of Hannibal breaking his winter quarters to a serpent emerging from its winter sleep. ‘MASK MASK’ has rather perplexed the commentators, some of whom wish to alter it, while others, rightly constructing it with ‘MASK MASK’ complain of the awkwardness of the separation of the words and of the tautology with ‘MASK MASK MASK’ Virg. however is fond of throwing MASK a word at the beginning of a simile to indicate as it were the main point and apply generally to what follows (comp. 1. 148 “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” 6. 707 “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” 12. 908 “MASK MASK MASK MASK”), and we may say here that ‘MASK MASK’ does the duty of a verb, which is consequently not needed till v. 474.

The external evidence against its genuineness is strong, stronger than against the genuineness of the former passage, the MSS. which contain the lines now in question being very few, and apparently none of them of great importance. The early interpreters do not comment on them, though their existence is recognized by a doubtful notice in Serv., which is the chief authority for the Tucca and Varius story. But when we come to internal considerations, the case is altered. The lines, though possibly disfigured by a few harshnesses, are vigorous and elaborate, and in general worthy of Virg. They are perhaps not required by the context, as v. 601 might be explained without them, and the appearance of Venus could be accounted for by supposing with Donatus that Aeneas was meditating suicide; but the context is improved by their presence, and v. 589, as Wagn. has pointed out, coheres rather awkwardly with v. 566. The aesthetical or ethical objection that has been taken to them, as if Virg. would not have made his hero think of killing a woman in a temple, seems to belong to a later age (see on v. 583), nor need the discrepancy between the present account of Helen and what we read 6. 510 foll. about her introducing the Greeks to the chamber of Deiphobus disturb us much, at the same time that one or both reasons may have led to their exclusion on critical grounds, whether by Tucca and Varius, or by some less authorized regulator of Virg.'s text. The external evidence however seems to me too formidably strong to be summarily ignored, so that I have followed the earlier editors, who enclose the passage in brackets, rather than the bulk of the later, who print it as an unquestioned part of the text. Where possibilities are so many and facts so few, an attitude of doubt seems the only one which can be safely assumed, except by those, who, like Jahn and Peerlkamp, condemn the lines unreservedly, on internal as well as external grounds.",,567-588,0,,,

13221712,aeneid_book2,Conington,"It is not easy to say whether ‘MASK’ is to be taken with Cerda and most of the later commentators of a pointed tongue of flame, or with Henry of the crown or topmost point (a tuft of hair, as he suggests with reference to ‘MASK’) of Ascanius' head. The latter would be supported by 10. 270, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” the ‘MASK’ there being the crest of the helmet which Aeneas happened to be wearing: the former has the authority of Ovid, who three times (F. 6. 636, M. 10. 279, Pont. 4. 9. 54) uses ‘MASK’ of a point or spire of flame, and agrees with Val. Fl. 3. 188, where “MASK MASK” seems to mean a luminous halo or star on the brow of Castor. This evidence in favour of a special use is to a certain extent confirmed by the language of the present passage, by the epithet ‘MASK’ and the words ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which do not agree equally well with Henry's view, as in that case ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ could hardly be separated. The tautology between ‘MASK MASK MASK’ (as explained of the flame) and ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ of which he complains, is not unVirgilian. It is singular that there should be two passages in later poets, one (Claud. 4 Cons. Hon. 192 foll.) alluding to, the other (Sil. 16. 119 foll.) modelled on, the present, in both of which the same doubt might be raised as here. A third interpretation, dating from Serv. and adopted by Burm., and more recently by Schirach, supposes the ‘MASK’ to be the Phrygian cap or mitre which Ascanius may have worn, as it is specially used of the cap worn by the “MASK” and “MASK” at Rome (see 8. 664, and Dict. A. ‘MASK’), which Serv. says Ascanius himself was the first to introduce at Alba: but the whole description seems to show that at this time at least his head was bare. The parallel instance in Roman legend, which doubtless was in Virg.'s mind, is the blazing of the hair of Servius Tullius when a boy, for which see Livy 1. 39. The appearance, wherever it was seen, was supposed to be an omen of future greatness, perhaps of royal dignity, so that here it points out Ascanius as a future king, and shows that the house of Aeneas is destined to survive. Virg. also had in view MASK “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”. — ‘MASK MASK’ seems to be a variety for “MASK MASK MASK” a form of expression of which Persius is particularly fond. “MASK MASK MASK” MASK , which Wund. and Jahn comp., is not parallel, as ‘MASK’ there is the passive supine. ‘MASK’ was adopted by Burm. from a few MSS.; but Virg. is not now thinking of a trail of light. ‘MASK’ is the reading of the great majority of MSS., and is doubtless right, though ‘MASK MASK’ the reading before Heyne, has some plausibility. It has been questioned whether ‘MASK’ belongs to ‘MASK’ or to ‘MASK MASK’ The imitation in Sil. l. c., where “MASK MASK” occurs, may seem to point to the former, and so perhaps MASK in Apoll. l. c.: but the concurrence of the two epithets ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ is a decided objection to it. The wavy, curling appearance of Ascanius' locks forms a natural object in the picture, and is in keeping with the character of the flames which play among them.","fundere lumen apex , tactuque innoxia mollis",683,1,,,

The sense of ‘MASK MASK’ seems to be fixed by the parallel 5. 526, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” to the imprinting of the meteor's path along the sky, ‘MASK’ being for obvious reasons substituted for “MASK MASK” otherwise it might be proposed to understand the words of the meteor symbolizing the path which Aeneas was to take (comp. Claudian De Laud. Stil. 2. 291, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”), an interpretation which would remove a certain appearance of tautology in what follows, and agree well with MASK “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”, ‘MASK MASK’ being in that case virtually equivalent to “MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK MASK’ Wagn. remarks that after the disappearance of the meteor any trail that it left would be more perceptible.

Med. and probably others write ‘MASK’ which, being taken as a diphthong, would naturally produce confusion. Heins. and Heyne, following some of Pierius' copies, read ‘MASK MASK MASK’ Myconus being called “MASK” by Ov.

One account was that Lavinia, the wife of Aeneas, was his daughter, and like him, a prophetess. He was himself represented by some as the son of Creusa. His friendship with Anchises is explained by the legend that Anchises had consulted him in former years whether he should go with Priam to Salamis to recover Hesione. We may perhaps wonder that Virg. should have mentioned him so slightly. Ovid, in the resumé of Aeneas' voyage which occupies parts of Books 13 and 14 of the Metamorphoses, introduces him more at length (13. 631—703), giving a conversation between him and Anchises, and describing in detail the presents which he and his guests exchanged at parting. ‘MASK MASK’ is the Homeric MASK MASK .

No tradition however appears to favour this view: and Virg. himself in 7. 219 apparently follows the Homeric story (Il. 20. 215), which makes Dardanus the son of Zeus. The legends vary (see Dict. Biog. Dardanus, Iasion): but those which assert MASK connexion between Dardanus and Iasion or Iasius make them brothers. This also might be reconciled with the text, which would then mean that the brothers sprung from Italy, and that Iasius, one of them, was the father of the Trojans. Here again however we should be at issue with the legends, and with Virg.'s language elsewhere, which speak of Dardanus as the author of the race, Iasius having settled, not in Phrygia, but in Samothrace. If then we wish to make Virgil consistent with himself, and with the line of tradition which he seems to have followed, we must suppose him to use ‘MASK’ rather vaguely, and to intend ‘MASK MASK’ to refer to Dardanus. But the language is certainly against this; and those who prefer to consider that he has attributed to Iasius what is elsewhere attributed to Dardanus may perhaps fortify themselves by appealing to 7. 208, where not Iasius but Dardanus is said to have penetrated into Samothrace.","Iasiusque pater , genus a quo principe nostrum",168,1,,,

Another story, also mentioned by Serv., made Abas the inventor of the shield.

But for these coincidences, the Abas of the present passage would be to us merely the name of some unknown Grecian warrior whom Aeneas had slain at some time or other, and whose shield he hangs up on Grecian soil as a crowning act of triumphant joy after an unmolested sojourn there.

The question is one of some interest, but belongs perhaps more properly to a treatise on Latin composition than to a commentary on a Latin poet.

The present participle at any rate is known to be much more idiomatic in Greek than in Latin. Hom. says in one of his most wonderful passages (Il. 6. 201) MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK . Cicero renders it nearly verbally (Tusc. 3. 26) “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and we at once feel the difference. As a matter of fact, one book of the Iliad (the 18th), and two of the Odyssey (the 5th and the 15th) end with the obnoxious participle.","Progredior portu , classis et litora linquens",300,1,,,

The external authority for the accusative is perhaps not great: in v. 303 above ‘MASK’ is corrupted into ‘MASK’ by fragm. Vat., and the ‘MASK’ here may have arisen from ‘MASK’ which in fragm. Vat., as in some other copies, was originally ‘MASK MASK’ But the common reading is objectionable as conveying an unfeeling reproach to Andromache, understood as it must be with Wagn., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”—a reproach, too, which would be unmeaning in itself, as Aeneas well knew that Andromache had become Pyrrhus' captive, and therefore, according to the Homeric usage, his concubine, and inconsistent with the previous context, as though Aeneas finds the rumour of Helenus' good fortune incredible, he nevertheless assumes its truth in action (v. 299). The force of these objections might be to a certain extent abated; but enough would remain to make the passage as commonly read difficult and awkward. If we accept the accusative, all is clear: Aeneas asks, as Henry remarks, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ the second clause going beyond the first, and referring to the report of her new prosperity, while in the third he inquires whether she is still united to Pyrrhus, in other words, whether the report is a false one. ‘MASK MASK’ will then balance ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ For the genitive ‘MASK MASK’ which, as Gossrau observes, is not elliptical but an ordinary possessive, see Madv. § 280, obs. 4. ‘MASK’ like “MASK” 10. 668, 12. 503, “MASK” 12. 797, the final ‘MASK’ being elided before a consonant no less than before a vowel.

In any case, as the language shows (comp. 2. 663), we are meant to think of Pyrrhus' death at the altar as a retribution for his murder of Priam.

Wagn. and Forb. complain that, as the text stands, Andromache makes no mention of Creusa, whom she could not know to be lost, and accordingly adopt, as does Ribbeck, ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK’ from the ‘MASK MASK’ separating ‘MASK MASK MASK’ from ‘MASK MASK’ (Ribbeck cites Med. for ‘MASK MASK’ but a friend who consulted the MS. for me assures me that it distinctly reads ‘MASK MASK’) They account for ‘MASK’ v. 341 by supposing that Aeneas gives some sign which shows that his wife is no more— an expedient which would scarcely be natural in an ancient drama, but is ridiculous in an epic.

If we may trust Serv., Virg. is not only accounting for a Roman custom, but glancing at a Trojan legend, to the effect that Diomede, being ordered by an oracle to restore the Palladium, came upon Aeneas while sacrificing, that Aeneas did not interrupt his worship, and that the restoration was consequently made not to him, but to Nautes. ‘MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK” 9. 120. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ the omens would have been taken before the sacrifice, and anything occurring during the sacrifice might spoil them.

The external authority however is strongly for ‘MASK MASK’ only inferior MSS. being cited for ‘MASK MASK’ and as the question seems not to be one of mere orthography, it is better to adopt the better attested word. The notion that Virg. was likely to have given the more colloquial name to the ship, the less colloquial to the actual fish, is refuted by the passage in Book 10.

Those who retain them are agreed about their general sense, viz. that in the extremity of their fear the Trojans remembered Helenus' warning about Scylla and Charybdis, and feeling that to be a greater danger even than the Cyclops, resolved to put back again, when the north wind sprung up and carried them into safety; but the processes which have been devised for getting that sense from the words are sufficiently various. On the whole the punctuation which gives the best sense seems to be that suggested by Vulpius on Tibull. 4. 1. 70 (after a hint of Serv.) and followed by Heyne and Henry, though there is still room for some difference of opinion on details of interpretation. Taking ‘MASK’ in the sense of “MASK” and regarding ‘MASK MASK’ as in opposition to ‘MASK MASK’ or, better perhaps, as a kind of cognate accusative expressing the effect of ‘MASK MASK’ (see on MASK ), I would translate ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The construction ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is fixed by the parallel 9. 143, where the words recur (as also in Ov. M. 7. 426), and by the similar expression “MASK MASK MASK” 10. 511, so that it will be a descriptive ablative. ‘MASK MASK’ may refer to the two passages, the one nearer to Scylla, the other to Charybdis, both of which were taken by Ulysses—or it may be only a poetical way of describing the one passage as dangerous on both sides. The use of ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK’ is supported by Donatus and Serv., and has vouchers in inscriptions and fragments of lost writings (see Forc.), while it is perhaps to be retained in such passages as MASK . For the position of ‘MASK’ comp. MASK . ‘MASK MASK’ occurs again 4. 46: “MASK MASK” we have had above v. 283. ‘MASK’ does not occur elsewhere in Virg.; but as it is a perfectly good Augustan word, that can be no reason for objecting to the genuineness of the lines, supposing it to be otherwise unimpeached. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as in Hor. 1 Od. 34. 3, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” On the whole we may pronounce that the harshness of the lines, though not to be extenuated, is not great enough to justify us in questioning their authorship, in the face of all external authority—backed as it is by Priscian, who quotes them twice, 15. 2, and 18. 79. The chief difficulty perhaps is in ‘MASK MASK’ for which we should have expected ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK’ v. 682 points to ‘MASK’ rather than to ‘MASK MASK’ The meaning may conceivably be that Aeneas' companions were more alarmed than himself, and took the matter into their own hands, as Ulysses (Od. 12. 224) fears his comrades may do. Heins. conj. ‘MASK MASK’ Ribbeck reads ‘MASK MASK MASK’ from fragm. Vat., and transposes vv. 685, 686, reserving explanation for his (unpublished) Prolegomena. The history of such passages as the supposed exordium of Book 1 and the episode of Helen in Book 2 shows that the early grammarians were jealous of interpolations in Virg.'s text, one recension being in fact a check upon another, so that intrinsic considerations require to be strong indeed in order to shake the credit of lines which no early critic is known to have suspected. With ‘MASK MASK MASK’ comp. MASK “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”, where the subject is, as here, the passage between Scylla and Charybdis.

There is however nothing unVirgilian in their language. ‘MASK’ does not stand simply for “MASK MASK” but has its usual sense, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ are undoubtedly MASK MASK in Virg., but they occur in other Augustan writers, and there is nothing in the last of them, as Forb. thinks, foreign to the Epic style: nor is it strange that Aeneas should call Ulysses ‘MASK MASK’ speaking of him in connexion with the partner of his wanderings, and for the moment sympathizing with him as a fellow-sufferer with himself. It may be true that the places mentioned here find no place in Hom.'s account of Ulysses' voyage: but Virg. evidently intends to accommodate Ulysses' journey, as he has done Aeneas', to his own views of geography, as we have just seen in the case of his territory of the Cyclops, which, though not the same as Hom.'s, is still represented as that which Ulysses visited. The intimation that Achemenides informed Aeneas of the names of the places, or (as the words may well mean) acted as his guide, was not necessary indeed, but cannot be called out of place. The construction of the words is not quite clear, as ‘MASK’ may be connected either with ‘MASK MASK’ or with ‘MASK MASK’ or again with both: but the last seems the most probable view. ‘MASK MASK’ then may be compared with “MASK MASK” Ov. F. 4. 573, though the meaning here is not so much ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ For ‘MASK’ some MSS. give ‘MASK’ It is noticeable that these verses also have the support of Priscian (11. 5. 21).",,"690,691",0,,,

In lengthening the final syllable of ‘MASK’ Virg. has followed the Greek (see Lachm. on MASK ). Silius Italicus on the contrary, in a similar enumeration of Sicilian cities (14. 218), has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” A difficulty has been made about ‘MASK MASK’ the “MASK” in the genitive being said not to be found in Virg.

Theron, whose Olympic victories Pindar celebrates, was of Agrigentum. ‘MASK’ comes in strangely, as it can hardly mean any thing but ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The only supposition seems to be that Virg., who throughout this paragraph lets Aeneas speak as he himself would have spoken (see on v. 700 above), here forgets himself, or rather his hero, so completely as to point a contrast between the time of the narrative and the time of the poem. A poet with his mind full of the literary and historical interest of his subject is perhaps not unlikely to allow the expression of that feeling to escape him even at the most inappropriate time. We may remember how gladly he avails himself of the prophetic power of Anchises in Book 6 to contrast the small beginnings of Italy with its subsequent greatness (6. 766), and how readily in the later books of the Aeneid he introduces a reference to his own time (12. 134).",Magnanimum,704,1,,,

If we adopt it, the sense will be that after surmounting so many storms, Anchises at last died in harbour, the feeling being like that of v. 711. ‘MASK’ on the other hand will express the same feeling as ‘MASK’ v. 710, Aeneas having sustained his trials by his father's help, and now being left alone just when he could bear it least. Or we may vary the thought slightly, and say that he means to represent this blow as the crowning evil of many, which is Wagn.'s view. Comp. 1. 240, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” “MASK MASK” occurs also 7. 199.

Virg. is fond of saying the same thing two or more times, partly from an imitation of epic simplicity, partly owing to his own love of variety in expression.

Possibly they may also be invoked as gods of the new colony, to further the political union between the Carthaginians and the Trojans. The epithet ‘MASK’ (a translation of MASK , a title of Demeter, Hdt. 6. 91 &c.) points that way: Apollo again is known to have been celebrated as the founder of cities (Dict. B. ‘MASK’), and Dionysus like Demeter was called MASK (Orph. H. 41. 1). Heyne goes farther, and attempts to show that these three divinities, like Juno, had a special relation to Carthage. Serv. accumulates a number of heterogeneous reasons for their introduction here, which are not worth quoting: he has preserved however two lines of Calvus, which illustrate the mention of Ceres: “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” There is a tantalizing passage in Macrob. Sat. 3. 12, where one of the speakers asks another whether he does not think Virgil has committed a great mistake here, in first saying ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ and then as it were recollecting himself and adding ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ a question which is followed by no answer or explanation of any sort, so that there is evidently a lacuna.

The libation was preliminary to the sacrifice: comp. 6. 244. Serv. on the latter passage says this was done to try the fitness of the victims—“MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” In Hom. the wine seems to have been poured either on the burning flesh of the victims (Il. 1. 462., 11. 775) or on the ground (3. 295, 300). Lersch (Antiqq. Vergg. p. 170) thinks the cow was offered specially to Juno, citing Tab. Fratr.

20154099,aeneid_book4,Conington,"as Wagn. says, merely distinguishes different parts of the same scene. Whether there is any special propriety in making Dido walk majestically before the altars does not appear. Serv. says that Roman matrons when about to sacrifice performed a sort of slow dance before the altar with torches in their hands; and the early editors follow him, referring to Hor. A. P. 232, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and to a passage in Prop. (2. 2. 7), “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which unfortunately is ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ 7. 764. Comp. below v. 202, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The statues of the gods, being in the temple, are of course supposed to be looking on. So v. 204, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”",Aut,62,1,,,
33709090,aeneid_book4,Conington,"Wagn. seems more successful in his attempt to fix a ceremonial sense in ‘MASK’ than in the case of ‘MASK’ (see on MASK ), with which he couples it. The account of this peculiar meaning would appear to be that stated recurrence is a notion so inseparably connected with any thing ritual, that recurring celebration comes to be talked of when nothing more than mere celebration is meant. It is nevertheless true that in many of the passages where it is used of observances there is a more distinct propriety in the notion of renewal, as in v. 145 note, 5. 94, where it is explained by “MASK MASK” 7. 146., 8. 283, where a second feast is spoken of. Thus Stat. Theb. 2. 88, borrowing the words “MASK MASK” from Virg., applies them to a feast which had been interrupted by a brawl. So in Livy 25. 16, when the sacrifice has been disturbed by a portent, it is said “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” It would be possible to give it some such reference here, Dido being said as it were to revive the flagging solemnities of the day as it wore on by ordering new sacrifices; but this would be too artificial. It is however countenanced by Donatus, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Serv. says, much less plausibly, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ladewig supposes Dido to order one sacrifice after another, a reference to which he sees in ‘MASK MASK MASK’ in the hope of obtaining a favourable manifestation, and then, when all fail, to throw the blame on the prophet or priests, v. 65; an exceedingly ingenious view, but one which an attentive consideration of the context will, I think, scarcely warrant. Dido, as the queen, would naturally be at the cost of the public sacrifices, like Clytaemnestra Aesch. Ag. 87 foll. Comp. 1. 632 note.","instauratque diem donis , pecudumque reclusis",63,1,,,
44523899,aeneid_book4,Conington,"of attentive gazing, as in Val. Fl. 5. 468 of attentive listening. Macrob. Sat. 3. 5 (closely followed by Serv. on v. 56 above) quotes Trebatius “MASK MASK MASK MASK” as distinguishing between two kinds of sacrifices, those made for the sake of consulting the will of the gods, called “MASK” and those where there is simply an offering of the victim's life, called “MASK MASK” Virg., he says, has mentioned both, the former here, the latter in v. 57. But surely a question may be raised whether the latter did not include the former. ‘MASK’ of palpitation; see Forc. s. v., where instances are given of its use ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’",Inhians,64,1,,,
09599948,aeneid_book4,Conington,"has been connected with ‘MASK MASK’ as in 8. 627, in the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’—a view which might be plausibly supported from v. 464 below. But the ordinary interpretation, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is clearly right, confirmed as it is by Appuleius, Met. 10. p. 682, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” where the reference is to the powerlessness of physic in the case of love, and by Sil. 8. 100, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” also an imitation of this passage (both quoted by Forb.). There is however some room for doubt as to the sentiment intended; Heyne thinks the prophets are censured as ignorant of the terrible future of Dido's love; Gossrau supposes Dido and Anna to be the ‘MASK MASK’ while Ladewig, as we have seen, understands the words as the expression of Dido's impatient despair. Probably Henry is right (after Serv. and Donatus) in supposing the meaning to be that “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” He goes on to say, “‘ Est mollis flamma medullas Interea : ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The hint of the words he seems right in tracing to a curious passage in MASK , where an oracular raven is heard ridiculing a prophet for his ignorance of the ways of a woman in love. The early critics raised aesthetic objections to this exclamation, saying that an epic poet ought not to obtrude his personality, and that Homer never does so.

For ‘MASK MASK’ almost all subsequent editors have adopted ‘MASK MASK MASK’ the conj. of Heins., which would introduce a more usual construction, and might be supported by 9. 143, where the MSS. are divided between “MASK MASK” and “MASK MASK MASK” But I believe the ablative to be as admissible as the accusative in this construction, though it is apparently very rare. The only undoubted instance of it I have met with is in the Pseudo-Donatus' Life of Virg. § 61, where a parody on the first line of E. 1 is quoted, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” (“MASK” conj. Heins.: but the parodist would naturally keep as close as he could to Virg.'s word). In Hor. 1 Ep. 5. 12, the best and most numerous MSS. give “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and in MASK one MS. has “MASK MASK MASK MASK” In expressions of this sort the MSS. are apt to vary considerably, as will be seen by consulting the various readings on the two passages just quoted: “MASK” is substituted for “MASK MASK” and the nominative for the acc. or abl.; e.g. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” “MASK MASK MASK MASK” Thus when in Sen.

Orig. 10 quoted on MASK and other old authorities to have been a distinct class of huntsmen. They are generally supposed to have been mounted like cavalry, of which the ‘MASK’ of the Roman army originally consisted: Mr. Long, however, thinks that they were beaters or drivers, so called from their position on the flank, the people for whom the game was driven answering to the legions in the centre. The other interpretation, understanding it of the red feathers with which the game was scared (see on MASK ), is not in Virg.'s manner, though it may suit a more modern taste, dwelling as it does on an unimportant circumstance, with the object of producing a picturesque effect. The change of nom. at ‘MASK MASK’ too, is an objection to this view, though a slight one.

Henry however apparently goes too far in supposing that stress is meant to be laid on the concurrence of the three deities essential to a perfect marriage, Juno, Venus, and MASK, as though this may be the spirit of the passages which he quotes from Ovid, esp. M. 9. 795, the absence of any reference to MASK below vv. 166 foll. seems to show that Virg. did not regard him as co-ordinate with Juno. Venus too, we must remember, is asked to give her tacit consent, not her active co-operation. ‘MASK’ may go either with ‘MASK’ or with ‘MASK MASK’ perhaps the latter is more probable.

The other circumstances of the simile correspond, as Heyne observes, to those in the simile of Dido to Diana 1. 498 foll. Apollo is supposed to fix his winter quarters in his temple at Patara in Lycia , and thence to go to Delos. Nothing is said about his dividing the year between the two, so that we need not speculate with Henry whether Delos is more than a halting-place on the way to Delphi. The journeyings of Apollo formed the subject of a paean by Alcaeus, the substance of which is preserved by Himerius, Orations 14. 10, and is extracted by Bergk, Poetae Lyrici Graeci , pp. 569, 570 (1st edition). From this it appears that when Apollo was born, Zeus gave him a mitre, a lyre, and a car driven by swans, and sent him to Delphi; but he chose first to go to the Hyperboreans, spending a year with them, and thence going to Delphi, where nature as well as men greeted him with demonstrations of welcome. A passage from Procopius cited by Turnebus, Adversaria 24. 26, speaks of the MASK MASK (an expression supported also by Himerius l. c.) as a festival at Delphi. Serv. says definitely that Apollo was supposed to give oracles for the six winter months at Patara, for the six summer ones at Delos: a practical realization of the belief in Apollo's migratory habits which is supported by Hdt. 1. 182, as Heyne observes in his Excursus. But the meaning may be, as Mr. Long thinks, that Apollo leaves Lycia in the winter, and goes to the more genial Delos—an interpretation already suggested as a question by Serv., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”",Qualis ubi hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta,143,1,,,

The ‘MASK’ was a matron who had only been married to one husband, and her function was to conduct the bride to the “MASK MASK” (Dict. A. Marriage, Roman). Juno performs this office here, as in MASK : but we may doubt with Keightley (Myth. p. 454, ed. 3) whether it was ever one of her regular titles. The whole description is rightly regarded by Henry as one not of an inauspicious but of an auspicious marriage, in which the gods take the parts ordinarily performed by mortals; the various phenomena of the storm being in fact regarded by Virg. as representing the various parts of the wedding solemnity, the lightning the holding up of the torches, the sounds of waters or woods the nuptial MASK . But he goes too far when he supposes the descent of rain upon the earth to be itself a symbolical marriage union between two great parts of nature. Such a notion is found in other passages of the classics (e. g. MASK ), but there is nothing to show that it is intended here.",Prima,166,1,,,
59065231,aeneid_book4,Conington,"It may be doubted whether ‘MASK MASK’ here means ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ (comp. 3. 239, 519 &c.), or ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ (comp. 8. 523., 12. 245). Nor is it clear in either case what parts are meant to be assigned to the Earth and Juno respectively, supposing, as was observed in the last note, that some natural phenomenon is intended by each of the actions ascribed here to the various deities. Taking ‘MASK’ as a sign, and so regarding ‘MASK MASK’ as that in which the sign consisted, we may account sufficiently well for the operation of Juno, who is the mistress of the atmosphere; but the office of Tellus is still undetermined. The generality of commentators, regarding the appearances as inauspicious, suppose the sign given by Earth to be the shock of an earthquake. This was probably the interpretation of Milton, who doubtless intended to imitate the passage in his description of the effects following the first act of sin (Par. Lost, 9. 782 foll., 1000 foll.). Henry thinks ‘MASK’ is a signal, which he supposes to be given by Tellus and Juno simply as persons, not as presiding powers of nature, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but this would spoil the symmetry of the passage, nor is it supported, as he thinks, by Claudian in Prob. MASK Olybr. Cons. 205 foll., where ‘MASK’ is evidently a sign or portent. Gossrau, who regards the manifestations as ambiguous, is similarly at a loss to know what part to assign to the Earth, and concludes “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ is rightly explained by Wagn. as i. q. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” For nuptial torches see MASK .",dant signum ; fulsere ignes et conscius aether,167,1,,,

For the synizesis comp. “MASK” 5. 269, and see 1. 73.

So Lucan 6. 258, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” The nymphs may be Oreads, Dryads, or Naiads, according to the view we take of the nature of the sound. Henry argues from ‘MASK MASK’ that they are Oreads, comp.

A reader of the present day will, I think, wonder rather at the poet's reticence than at his exuberance. The mighty power of Fame or Rumour is a conception which will bear dwelling on; the thought is appropriate here, as one of the main causes which lead to Dido's death is the sense of the disgrace to which she has brought herself before the world: and Virgil's treatment of MASK is quite in the taste of classical poetry. Such mythological personifications are common enough in Ovid, and MASK is hard to see why Virg. should be altogether debarred the use of them, though doubtless they are to be more sparingly employed in a poem like the Aeneid than in a poem like the Metamorphoses. The hint, as usual, is from Homer, who personifies MASK Il. 2. 93, Od. 24. 412, which last line Virg. has almost copied in the present v. 173; the elaboration of detail too partly comes from the Homeric, MASK , Il. 4. 442, 443.

That he was thinking of the future of Italy is shown by the word ‘MASK’ and by the whole context, as the temper of the Italian nations at the time of Aeneas' arrival was a matter of infinitely small moment compared with the destiny in store for them: at the same time it was the imperious and unbridled character of those nations which marked them out as instruments in the conquest of the world after they should have been conquered themselves, first by Aeneas and eventually by Rome, so that Italy could be said to be not only the future mother of empire, but actually teeming with it at the moment when Jupiter was speaking.

Theb. 3. 129) and ‘MASK’ (Varro ap. Non. 2. 785) were used of closing the eyes of the dead, so that ‘MASK’ would naturally express the reverse process. It does not appear that this action is clsewhere attributed to Mercury; but it would be a natural part of the Roman conception of a MASK , the object being, as Henry suggests, that the dead might see their way to the lower world. We may add this then to the other instances in which Virg. has mixed the customs of his own times with those of the heroic age. ‘MASK’ then will mean during, i. e. after, death, and the words will = “MASK MASK MASK MASK”","dat somnos adimitque , et lumina morte resignat",244,1,,,

The belief that Atlas stood as a pillar between heaven and earth doubtless seemed a reason for his introduction here, though perhaps it rather confuses the image. Voss (Mythologische Briefe, vol. 2, letter 27, referred to by Henry) suggests a more elaborate explanation, according to which there were three openings in the heavenly Olympus, one in the vertex, immediately over the earthly mountain, the other two at the sides, eastern and western, the latter being the route taken by Mercury as the nearest to Carthage. I do not know whether it is an objection to this view that when in 1. 225 Jupiter looks down upon Libya, he is expressly said to be standing not at the west gate of Olympus but at the vertex: but in any case it seems rash to suppose that the ancient poets generally were agreed in their notions of Olympian topography.",nubila ; iamque volans apicem et latera ardua cernit,246,1,,,

See note at the end of this book. The chief internal ground is the awkwardness of expression in v. 257, as it would be equally objectionable to remove the point after ‘MASK MASK’ so as to connect ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ to make ‘MASK MASK MASK’ a zeugma for “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and to adopt the reading ‘MASK MASK MASK’ which the instances quoted by Weichert do not sufficiently support.

There it was almost necessary, as there is no pronoun in v. 232 to fix the reference pointedly to Aeneas: here the emphatic position of ‘MASK’ in v. 260 renders the addition needless, though it is still graceful.

At the second apparition (v. 556 foll.), which however differs from this as taking place in sleep, the fact is told us directly. Serv. remarks that Mercury had repeated all his message, and accordingly understands ‘MASK MASK’ to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ in other words, without giving Aeneas time to reply. Donatus has the same interpretation, which is certainly an ingenious one. Gossrau accepts it. But we should not be justified in fixing this special sense of ‘MASK’ unless we could prove that it was never used where only one person was speaking, which 12. 940 shows not to be the case. ‘MASK MASK’ then will have its ordinary sense, which must be explained by supposing either that Mercury became actually invisible before his speech was ended, or that his speech seemed to end abruptly from the suddenness with which he closed it and vanished. In either case the expression is rhetorical and must not be closely pressed, as all that the poet means is to give the effect of a sudden and transient apparition. So below v. 388 there is no sign of imperfection in Dido's actual speech, but “MASK MASK MASK” is intended to mark the abruptness and violence of her manner in closing it.",mortalis visus medio sermone reliquit,277,1,,,

Either we must suppose Dido to have known of the indignation of Iarbas on hearing of her preference of Aeneas, or we must understand her to mean no more than that she has alienated her neighbours by refusing them the love which she has since bestowed on Aeneas. The last would be a sufficiently natural way of speaking in the bitterness of her despair, especially as she would feel that the indignation of her former suitors would be doubled as soon as she was known to have given herself to another. Perhaps the same explanation may apply to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ which according to this would refer either to suitors at Tyre (v. 35) or to Pygmalion, either of whom might be expected to resent the new alliance.

Accepting this view, which Serv. supports, I should understand the inaction to refer not, as he thinks, to the relations between Dido and Aeneas, as if she were content that he should no longer regard her as his wife during the rest of his stay, but to Aeneas' journey; a time when he will do nothing, and when she may consequently breathe.

29024168,aeneid_book4,Conington,"These two lines must be taken together, as the sense of ‘MASK MASK’ depends on that which we attribute to v. 436. The latter is well known as the most difficult in Virg. The reading is not quite certain. Not to mention the obvious errors of unimportant MSS., a considerable number of copies give ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK’ while Med., Pal., and Gud. a m. pr. have ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK’ and Med. ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK’ These varieties are all mentioned by Serv., who says that ‘MASK’ was the reading of Tucca and Varius. ‘MASK’ may be dismissed as probably an interpretation of ‘MASK MASK’ fixing it to the particular sense of returning a favour at death as a bequest left by the dying. There is the same variety in the MSS. in Pers. Prol. 5. ‘MASK’ is more plausible, as the ‘MASK MASK’ may be well said with Henry to answer to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ v. 429, the grace of a brief delay. But Henry has forgotten that it may answer equally well to ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ v. 420, the favour which Dido begs of her sister, of carrying this message to Aeneas: and it cannot be denied that ‘MASK MASK’ is strongly in favour of so interpreting it, though the words might mean—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ There is then no overpowering prima facie reason for adopting ‘MASK MASK’ nor do the interpretations proposed by its supporters supply any additional argument in its favour. If indeed we might read with the Delphin editor ‘MASK MASK’ we should obtain a clear and intelligible sense—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ I do not know why Wagn. calls this “MASK MASK” the objection which occurs at first sight, that Dido would thus speak too plainly of a resolution which she afterwards takes such pains to conceal from her sister, is, as we shall see, not convincing: the expression would, I think, strike any one as sufficiently natural and unforced, if the reading were undoubted; and the strongest improbability in the case is the general one founded on the almost invariable trustworthiness of one or other of Virg.'s MSS. Henry's interpretation adopts not only ‘MASK’ but ‘MASK MASK’ understanding Dido to say that if Aeneas grants her the favour of a little delay, she, though brought lower than the grave (‘MASK MASK’ = in aggravated death, in a state worse than death), will abate her passion. The intransitive sense of ‘MASK’ is possible enough: but the interpretation of ‘MASK MASK’ is absolutely impossible, and not justified by a less forced expression in a more forced writer, Statius, who in Theb. 11. 582 speaks of Oedipus' blindness as “MASK MASK MASK” On the whole, the chief value of ‘MASK’ seems to be that it has given occasion for a very ingenious conjecture of Schrader, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ which would suit ‘MASK MASK’ the sense produced being ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Accepting the ordinary reading as having the authority of Serv., we shall not find much difficulty in giving ‘MASK’ the sense of “MASK MASK” though it does not seem to have been generally used as its conventional equivalent (comp. Hor. A. P. 349, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”), while ‘MASK’ will naturally mean ‘MASK MASK’ as in Livy 2. 23, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ may be either the abl. instr. with ‘MASK MASK’ or used as in v. 502 below, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Here again the difficulty is in the general sense. Roughly considered, the meaning seems to be that Dido's death will bring to Anna a return for her kindness; but it is not easy to see what the return can be, and so to determine whether the death is to be the cause of its being made or merely the occasion. Wagn.'s notion that Dido hints that she will bequeath her kingdom to Anna is unworthy of the occasion, and not supported by any thing else in this book, while it has not even the justification of consistency with the legend, which makes Anna after her sister's death migrate into Italy. Perhaps we may say, borrowing a hint from Serv., that Dido's language is intentionally obscure, her meaning being that her return for Anna's kindness will be that she will kill herself, and so rid her sister of the burden. Anna would take the words as a mere expression of desperation, their very obscurity preventing her from attaching too much meaning to them. So her language in v. 419 is worded in a manner which might have led any one already on the watch to infer the worst, while an unsuspecting person like Anna would take it in a good sense, knowing moreover, as Virg. reminds us v. 502, that Dido had once before endured successfully what seemed even a worse sorrow. Generally we may say that while Dido's purpose is still undecided, she does not shrink from speaking of death, though her words are little more than those of vague desperation. It is only when she has seen death to be her only course that she is anxious that no one should suspect what she is meditating. Sophocles has represented just the same change of feeling in Ajax, who talks wildly of death on his first recovery from his frenzy, but afterwards, when he is quite resolved to die, contrives an elaborate blind for Tecmessa and the Chorus. Thus that Dido should speak of death here is no more than we should expect, though the precise import of her words may be left undetermined. Ribbeck, adopting ‘MASK MASK’ reads ‘MASK MASK MASK’ apparently from his own conjecture. The old editors placed the comma after ‘MASK MASK’ not after ‘MASK MASK’ With the parenthetical ‘MASK MASK’ comp. “MASK MASK” v. 478, which may be meant as a contrast to it. ‘MASK’ of a favour. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ter.

Such a feeling, it is true, is not the simple feeling of an old poet: to conceive of any thing of the kind in Homer would involve a grotesque impossibility. But the comparison of one mythical person to another is equally foreign to Homer. His similes are limited in their range: heroes and their actions are paralleled to the more ordinary occupations of life, to inferior creatures or natural phenomena. He does not tell us that Achilles resented the abduction of Briseis as Meleager did the slight offered to Atalanta. Virg. must be judged by his own standard; and there is nothing inconsistent with that standard in supposing that the Pentheus of his thoughts was the Pentheus of Euripides, the MASK of Aeschylus. He doubtless felt that it was to the stage that he owed the glorious vision of their madness, and he was glad to make the acknowledgment. It is this feeling which dictates the presents, ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ The frenzy of the Theban and the Argive is not a thing of the past, embalmed in legend; it is constantly repeating itself; it is present as often as the Bacchae or the Eumenides are acted, read, or remembered. As before, we cannot determine whether Virg. had any single play exclusively in his mind. Serv. says that Pacuvius (in his Dolorestes or Dulorestes?) represented MASK as entering Apollo's temple at the instance of Pylades and being attacked by the Furies when he tried to leave it. In Aesch. Eum. the ghost of Clytaemnestra appears, but does not haunt MASK, contenting herself with stirring up the Erinnyes. ‘MASK MASK’ I understand to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ the sense of ‘MASK’ being fixed by the context, and by the parallels 3. 331., 12. 668, Cic. Rosc. Am. 24, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” That Ausonius uses the words ‘MASK MASK’ in the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK’ may prove that he had Virg.'s words in his mind, but need only prove further that he did not consider himself bound by Virg.'s meaning, when another suited him better and suited the genius of the language as well. In other words, the objection to the interpretation which Serv. gives as an alternative to that adopted above, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” is not that it is doubtful Latin, but that it would yield a very frigid sense. I will now transcribe the passage to which I referred from Valerius Flaccus , as the detail into which the description is carried makes it more than a mere repetition of Virg. The comparison is to Medea's lovesick distraction— “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”",aut Agamemnonius scaenis agitatus Orestes,471,1,,,

The dragon is induced by being fed with dainties, ‘MASK’ &c. standing in effect for “MASK MASK MASK” Henry rightly understands ‘MASK MASK MASK’ of sprinkling the food with honey and poppyseeds, which he shows from various passages in Petronius, from Pliny 19. 8. 53, and from Hor. A. P. 375, to have been considered a great delicacy among the Romans, forming, at least in early times, part of the second course at a banquet. That ‘MASK’ means sprinkling on the food, not sprinkling on the ground as a separate and substantive article of food, he argues from a passage where Petronius says, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ too favours this. ‘MASK’ it must be admitted, is a very unfortunate epithet, as the object of the food cannot have been to lull the ever-wakeful dragon; it is not simply inappropriate or idle, like other epithets which Henry or others quote, but actually mal à propos. As a physical description it is accurate enough, the “MASK MASK“somniferum”MASK MASK” being specified by Pliny as the particular kind of poppy whose seeds were so employed. All attempts to modify or evade this obvious sense must be pronounced failures: e. g. Serv.'s new punctuation, adopted by Gossrau, which connects ‘MASK’ &c. with what follows, Turnebus' fancy that the dragon required to be put to sleep occasionally that he might not break down from overwatching, Jahn's supposition that honey and poppies were strewn about to keep intruders away, and Waddel's suggestion that the priestess may have dealt with soporifics as Macbeth wished to deal with physic, throwing them to the dogs to keep them out of the dragon's way. But perhaps it may still be open to some unusually audacious critic to hint that Virg., by a strange confusion, such as might possibly happen to a great writer who never lived to revise his poem, thought of the dragon for the moment as a creature which the priestess was to subdue or elude, and so made her exercise her charming power in sending it to sleep. Medea, who, as we have seen, has been in his mind throughout the composition of this Book, sprinkles her MASK on the dragon's eyes ( MASK foll.), and Virg. himself in describing an enchanter 7. 750 foll. speaks of him as one “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ribbeck, with sufficient improbability, places v. 486 after v. 517 below. ‘MASK MASK’ to Juno, to Venus, or to Earth, according to different accounts.",,"485,486",0,,,

A funeral pile is raised, with all its accoutrements (see v. 506), really to serve for Dido , but apparently for Aeneas, who is to be burnt in effigy (v. 508), as being dead to Dido.

She wishes that she had been born to a wild life in the woods, like Camilla, without any thought of wedlock. It is not constancy to her first mate, but simply wildness, undisturbed by human passions and frailties, that is now in her mind. ‘MASK MASK’ is startling, but it ceases to be strange if we understand it, with Henry, not of a beast's life as contrasted with a man's in respect of the union of the sexes, but generally of the life of beasts as contrasted with civilization and its attendant weaknesses. Camilla's virginity arose out of her wild life: she would not submit to a husband's yoke, as her father would not yield to civic restraints, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” 11. 568.

The Greek use of MASK for unmarried seems indeed to express the main thought which Virg. wished to convey. This may perhaps be a sufficient account of words which have caused so much perplexity, though it would be well if further illustration could be obtained. Serv. thinks the reference is to a particular kind of beast, such as a lynx, which, if a quotation he makes from Pliny is to be trusted, after losing its first mate never takes a second. Mr. Long explains ‘MASK MASK’ by ‘MASK MASK MASK’ beasts having no sense of good and evil. Quinct. Inst. 9. 2. 64 notes this as an instance of concealed feeling breaking out, Dido, in the very words in which she inveighs against marriage, acknowledging that it is the state for men as men.

It is still a question whether ‘MASK MASK’ is said by Dido of herself or of Aeneas. The latter is supported by Dido's language v. 496 above, and by Tibull. 3. 6. 42, quoted by Wagn., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” of Theseus' desertion of Ariadne. But in this case it is difficult to explain the next line, the full construction of which must be ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Dido had no reason to think Aeneas treacherous when she offered him a share in the crown: he had treated no one else with the same perfidy. Wagn. attempts to get over this by understanding ‘MASK MASK’ “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but the question recurs, had be given ground for suspicion? The very next words seem to say that all his previous actions had been in his favour, and that his present faithlessness makes her disbelieve that they ever took place. Her regret for not having slain him, vv. 600 foll., refers not to the time of her welcoming him, but to that of her becoming first aware of his treachery, as ‘MASK’ v. 604 shows. It seems better then to understand ‘MASK MASK’ of Dido's own faithlessness to the memory of Sychaeus, with Henry, who comp. Medea's self-reproach, MASK “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”, and Deianira's “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” MASK . It may seem indeed that Ovid himself sanctions this interpretation, as his preceding line is “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which may be an imitation of v. 595. Heyne, who also refers ‘MASK MASK’ to Dido, thinks she is struck with horror at her wish to avenge herself on her lover, and then wishes that her moral sense had been as keen earlier: but this is far less likely, and scarcely consistent with the access of fury v. 600, or indeed with the tone of the whole speech, which, tempestuous as it is, gives no sign of relenting towards Aeneas.

94211950,aeneid_book4,Conington,"Virg. has doubtless framed Dido's imprecations so that, while intended by her to be all that is dreadful, they should be susceptible of a much more endurable fulfilment. The imprecation of Polyphemus in Homer is something of the same kind: there however the relief is found in the fact that the curse only extends to Ulysses' arrival MASK home, and so is not incompatible with his subsequent triumph over his enemies. Dido is more unrelenting: she prays that he may have to fight, to leave his settlement and his son, implore foreign aid, submit to a disgraceful peace, die prematurely, and be deprived of burial. Aeneas does meet with opposition (Book 7): he has to leave Ascanius in the camp and entreat aid from Evander (Books 8 and 9): the final peace involves concessions to the Latins and the extinction of the Trojan name (Book 12): while his death, according to one legend, which Virg. probably followed (see 1. 265), happened when he had reigned only three years, and his body, if not left ‘MASK MASK MASK’ did not meet with burial, being swallowed up in the Numicius, or, according to another account, not being found after a battle. Yet Aeneas' career after reaching Italy would have been felt to be a prosperous one, just as the Romans of Virg.'s day would feel that the eternal feud between Troy and Carthage, and the actual appearance of the threatened avenger, were not painful but glorious recollections. The Sibyl, however (6. 83 foll.), takes a similar, though less gloomy view of Aeneas' future in Italy.

So the ancients seem themselves to have understood the passage, MASK and Sil. 8. 148, speaking of Dido as slaying herself with the sword Aeneas had given her—if indeed the coincidence does not show that this was one of the points of the legend. Yet this seems inconsistent with the words of v. 507, which can hardly be understood of a thing which did not belong to Aeneas at the time of his departure. The alternative seems to be to suppose the sword to have been Dido's present to Aeneas, already mentioned v. 261 foll., which he may be assumed to have left behind him MASK his haste. ‘MASK’ then would have to mean ‘MASK’ as Aeneas was not likely to have begged for it.

Dido first says that she has lived her life, and will die a queen, and then briefly but with dignity enumerates her actions as if she were writing an epitaph, adverting at the close to the one cloud on her history. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ see Madvig § 297. b. obs. 1.",et nunc magna mei sub terras ibit imago,654,1,,,

The opposite of these kinds of death is expressed in the next line, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” she did not wait till fate summoned her: her death was not predestined but sudden. The distinction which Virg. intends is practical rather than philosophical, and the words employed must not be weighed too nicely. Serv. felt there was an inconsistency, asking how Dido's death ‘MASK MASK’ can be reconciled with Jupiter's declaration 10. 467, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but his distinction between ‘MASK MASK’ and ‘MASK MASK’ scarcely removes it. In one of the passages quoted by Henry to substantiate the sense of ‘MASK MASK’ Tac.

B. 1 (14th century), Auct. B. B. 2 (? apparently late), and Auct. F. 2. 5 (middle of 15th century). MASK A. A. 1 and B. B. 2 ‘MASK’ is written above the line. MASK F. 2. 5 ‘MASK’ appears for ‘MASK MASK’ there being a blank space where ‘MASK’ has been erased. MASK B. B. 2 ‘MASK’ is written apparently by the same hand as the rest of the line, but at a later time, as if a blank space had been originally left and afterwards filled MASK. MASK A. A. 1 and B. B. 2 v. 257 precedes v. 256, but the order is corrected MASK the margin. The inverted order is also found MASK the text of one of the other MSS. which I examined, and MASK the margin of another.

In other words, Virg. assumes for rhetorical purposes that the thing is half done, an assumption which here is contrary to the fact, while there, for aught we know, it may be consistent with it. 4. 277 is nearer the mark, as we can hardly suppose that Mercury ceased to be visible in the middle of his speech, so that we may say that there the word stands for something more than half, as here for something less than half. ‘MASK MASK’ 2. 359.",Medium iter,1,1,,,

If by ‘MASK MASK’ is meant to leave the contest undecided, which is the general opinion (Heyne, who adopts it, referring ‘MASK’ to Helymus as a person), there can be little doubt that ‘MASK’ should be read, as it could not be said that in a context like this the two cases could be represented except as alternatives. And this interpretation seems to be exactly confirmed by Il. 23. 382, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK , which Virg. probably had in his mind, as ‘MASK MASK’ seems to be modelled on Hom.'s description in the three lines immediately preceding. But there is another passage which also Virg. had before him, Il. 23. 526, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK , and this would suggest another interpretation of Virg.'s words, proposed long ago by Turnebus 14. 4, apparently adopted by Cerda, and now revived by Henry, who does not seem aware that he has been anticipated, giving ‘MASK’ the special sense of leaving behind in a race, like the passive MASK (comp. Hor. A. P. 417, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and other places), so that the meaning will be ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ i. e. would make him doubtful no longer, but clearly defeated. This view I now accept, as satisfactory in itself and recommended by the unanimous concurrence of the MSS. in ‘MASK MASK’ though, had the preponderance been reversed, I should see no sufficient reason for leaving the ordinary interpretation. Against the new one it may perhaps be urged that it does not bring Virg. into absolute conformity with Hom., who does not mean that Menelaus and Antilochus were MASK as it was, but that Menelaus in a longer course would not only have become MASK but superior, while Virg. on the other hand, as thus interpreted, represents Helymus as already no more than ‘MASK MASK’ and also that the case of Helymus and Diores is more like that of Eumelus and Diomed, who were nearly even from the first, than that of Menelaus and Antilochus, whose places were reversed during the race by an act of fraud, so that Menelaus, in passing his rival, would only have been asserting the intrinsic superiority which he had all along.

But without going back to the sacrifice nine days before, v. 97, we may suppose not unreasonably that a sacrifice had been performed to Anchises before the games, though Virg., true to his love of variety, even at the expense of perspicuity, has not chosen directly to inform us of it. We need not settle the topography of the circus; but it cannot have been at any great distance from the tomb. ‘MASK’ expresses, not that the slaughter was an ordinary occurrence, but that part of the course happened to pass over the ground where the slaughter had taken place—a thing which is fairly called accidental, as it cannot have been intended.

Heyne's pointing, which separates ‘MASK MASK’ both from ‘MASK MASK’ and from ‘MASK MASK’ &c., is contrary to the usage of Virg., who never uses ‘MASK MASK’ without something to qualify and complete it, except where it is connected with words expressing the direction of the motion, as in 2. 672., 6. 241., 7. 492; and Jahn's (ed. 1), ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK“ iactabat ”MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ introduces a sense of ‘MASK MASK’ unknown to Virg., though justifiable in itself. ‘MASK MASK’ coming to Troy to take part in the games, not =“MASK MASK” a sense of the word which, as Wagn. says, is only found in the case of plants. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ however are not to be connected, as if it were “MASK MASK MASK MASK” though we have “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” 10. 719.

If we could suppose the mention of Dares' exploits to have been actually made by the spectators, the epithet might pass as one of those details which sometimes associate themselves in the memory with more important events, and so might have a psychological truth. Such a thing however is not likely to have occurred to Virg., whose style of art is different: so we must put down the use of the epithet to an unseasonable imitation of Homeric simplicity. More might have been said for it had it occurred in the course of the ordinary narrative, as there many details may bear to be enumerated, whereas in a brief recollection like this only the more important points can properly be noticed.

Aeneas, immediately on its appearance, as we shall see (v. 530), interprets it favourably, but what happened subsequently showed that he was mistaken. What then was the event portended? The old interpretation was, the burning of the ships: but this disaster, soon over and soon repaired, would hardly suit v. 524, which points apparently to something more terrible and more distant. Wagn. supposes it to be the impending war in Italy; but Acestes had nothing to do with this either as actor or as sufferer. It seems more probable that Heyne is right in referring it to the wars between Rome and Sicily. But there is no need to fix it at all, as long as we regard it as identified with some adequate occurrence in the subsequent history of Sicily. Wagn. censures the awkwardness of alluding to something extraneous to the poem and not specified; but Gossrau remarks that Virg. is probably not inventing this story of the portent and its supposed accomplishment, but repeating what he found in a legend. Med., Pal., Gud., Rom., and others have ‘MASK MASK’ as Med., Pal., and Verona fragm. have in 2. 680: wrongly in both places. The awkwardness of the connexion “MASK MASK” might be got over (see above on v. 498); but ‘MASK’ would create an inexcusable ambiguity with ‘MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK’ itself is not strictly co-ordinate with ‘MASK MASK’ being a predicate. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ strictly speaking the thing was an ‘MASK’ already, but as it was not understood as such, its augurial character is spoken of as future. In other words ‘MASK’ points to the estimation of the thing, not to its nature. ‘MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK” 7. 146, the epithet being equally applicable to good and evil.",Hic oculis subito obicitur magnoque futurum,522,1,,,

The natural way of understanding would seem to be that all have their hair bound (comp. 4. 148, “MASK MASK MASK”） with a wreath of stripped leaves (‘MASK MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ comp. v. 774, MASK note). But how is this to be reconciled with their wearing helmets (v. 673)? Wreaths were sometimes put over the helmet, as appears from 7. 751, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which would agree with ‘MASK’ here, that being probably a sign that oliveleaves are meant (v. 774 &c.). But MASK that case the hair must be confined by the helmet, not by the wreath. Cerda proves from MASK , Fast. 3. 2 that ‘MASK’ would naturally be said of the pressure of a helmet (comp. also 9. 612, “MASK MASK MASK”), as ‘MASK’ of its removal; but this will not help us here, unless we are to suppose that Virg. is thinking of wreath and helmet both, while only mentioning the former. Peerlkamp apparently considers the wreath to be under the helmet, to which Forb. answers, that MASK that case the helmet would not fit. But it seems possible that there might be a wreath worn just below the helmet, so as not to interfere with it— a variety of the custom mentioned 7. 751. And MASK this interpretation I incline to acquiesce, till a better shall have been proposed. Henry, following Gesner MASK his Thesaurus, thinks the meaning is that the hair of the boys was cut round, as was that of the Roman boys (a custom expressed by ‘MASK MASK’ according to Virg.'s usual habit of ascribing Roman usages to the Trojans). He compares the words used by St. Jerome MASK translating and commenting on Ezekiel 44. 20, where the poll of the Jewish priests is spoken of (a mode of wearing the hair which he believes to have been as nearly as possible the same as that MASK use among the Roman boys), “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” the use of ‘MASK’ for pruning or lopping leaves ( MASK &c.), and that of ‘MASK’ MASK modern Italian for pollarding a tree. But these parallelisms are by no means equal MASK value to those adduced MASK support of the other interpretation: and moreover the passage, so interpreted, would be inconsistent with 10. 137, where we are expressly told that Ascanius' hair was not cropped, but only confined by a gold band. ‘MASK MASK’ which he thinks cannot refer to any peculiarity of the game, this being its first exhibition, need merely mean ‘MASK MASK MASK’ implying that all observed the fashion, established as it was then for the first time.

Heyne thought that ‘MASK MASK MASK’ perhaps meant each splits into four companies of three horsemen each, which would complicate the picture needlessly: Wagn. and Forb. suppose no more to be meant than that the three ‘MASK MASK’ having been together while they passed in procession, now separate: but, as Henry remarks, the previous context, so far from leading us to suppose that they ever formed into one, distinctly suggests the contrary. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ according to Virg.'s wont, is explained by the following clause. There is something antithetical in the combination of the two words, ‘MASK’ alone suggesting the notion of irregular dispersion (9. 164., 12. 590), as if it had been said “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ being distributed into three, that being as it were the basis of their ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK MASK MASK’ they separate, keeping their original distinction into three, so that there are not simply two companies, right and left, but three pairs of companies. One difficulty remains which Henry has not noticed: when the three companies are divided into pairs, there are still only three leaders. This may not be fatal to the interpretation; but it can only be met by charging Virg. with an oversight.","Olli discurrere pares , atque agmina terni",580,1,,,

Virg.'s words, it seems to me, become purposely rather indefinite at this point, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ merely expressing that these retreats and charges keep going on in one form or another. ‘MASK MASK’ (so Wagn. from Med. and Rom., for ‘MASK MASK’ Pal. and Gud.) seems to imply that they still keep their ground, right and left respectively, as they took it in v. 580, though they are continually advancing and retreating over the ground. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ opposed in point of ground, is of course the same thing as ‘MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘alternisque’MASK MASK MASK MASK’ is I think rightly referred by the generality of the commentators to complicated circular evolutions as it were entangling each other. The ‘MASK’ are not really confused, but their movements are so ingeniously intricate that they appear confused: the effect produced is that of circles involved in or cutting each other. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” occurs 8. 448 of the shield of Aeneas, where, though the entanglement of the circles is not the same as that here supposed, the picture is still less like what Henry imagines, circles preventing each other from being circles. Besides, Virg. has himself shown that he intends not single but highly complicated evolutions by the comparison to the labyrinth which immediately follows—a comparison which would be unmeaning if the movements of the ‘MASK’ had been such as the eye could easily trace. Whether these circular evolutions are the same as what is described generally in v. 583, or something different, it is not easy to say. There will be no reference in any case to the military sense of ‘MASK’ ( = ‘MASK’） for a mass of men. ‘MASK’ implies that the complication was reciprocal. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ seems to be general—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The expression is from MASK , 324, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” which is actually copied below v. 674. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ above v. 440.",,583-585,0,,,

There is a simile from dolphins in MASK , where their gambols are dwelt on more in detail: “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” But Virg. has perhaps shown judgment in not describing their movements after having been so minute in representing the evolutions which he compares to theirs: he does little more than name them, and leaves his readers who have seen them to fill up the picture for themselves. For a similar instance of judicious reticence see on MASK . ‘MASK MASK’ apparently a solitary example of the use of ‘MASK’ with a gen. in Virg. ‘MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK” 12. 476.","delphinum similes , qui per maria umida nando",594,1,,,

Heyne condemns and Wagn. omits it, but it seems unobjectionable and even good in itself. As usual in such cases, I have retained it in brackets.

In ‘MASK’ there is doubtless an allusion to the ‘MASK MASK MASK’ though there is nothing to show the precise sense which Virg. attached to that disputed term. The application of the epithet to the Sabines (7. 706) and to the Quirites (7. 710) is in favour of giving it its simplest meaning here, the early Latins, as distinguished from those of later Roman history.","rettulit , et priscos docuit celebrare Latinos",598,1,,,

Internal evidence, as Heyne admits, would seem to be in favour of ‘MASK’ Thrace and Troy were neighbouring and allied countries, and a Trojan woman might easily marry a Thracian; while those who vindicate Tmarus have to suppose that Beroe left Troy with Helenus, married in Epirus, and (probably becoming a widow) accompanied Aeneas. But the external authority for ‘MASK’ is too great to be resisted, the only evidence for ‘MASK’ among Ribbeck's MSS. being an abortive attempt in Med. to correct ‘MASK MASK’ the original reading, into ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK’ so that we must suppose Virg. to have introduced another reference (comp. note on v. 360) to Aeneas' visit to Epirus, either from a legend now lost, or from his own spirit of invention, seeking to give an air of verisimilitude to a narrative which has not the background of a consistent history.

There is nothing in the context to show whether the bow along which Iris descended (v. 609) was visible, or, like herself, invisible, nor yet whether it remained after she came down.

On the other hand, an objection might perhaps be raised with justice to Aeneas' separating himself from the rest, as he does according to the common interpretation, and calling for his own destruction as the one thing wanted to crown the national misery.

The sense would seem to require that we should supply some antecedent for ‘MASK’ from the sentence itself, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ &c., or regard ‘MASK’ as acc. pl. of ‘MASK MASK’ But I believe Virg. meant ‘MASK’ to be connected with ‘MASK MASK’ speaking of the responses as portended by the wrath of heaven or demanded by the order of fate, to show how completely the responses represented and were identified with the events. The events or responses are said to be portended by the wrath of the gods, whereas we should rather expect to hear that the wrath of the gods was itself portended by supernatural appearances: but though ‘MASK’ seems generally to bear the latter meaning, the substantive ‘MASK’ is quite in accordance with the former. ‘MASK MASK’ occurs elsewhere, as in MASK , of a god giving forth a response to those who consulted him, but there can be no reason why it should not be used also of suggesting a response to another which he is to give forth.

The common reading is ‘MASK MASK’ two MSS. have ‘MASK’ as a various reading, and Rom. and another MS. give ‘MASK MASK’ The last is adopted by Henry: but it seems to have arisen from a recollection of 4. 53, as has so often happened in similar cases. Between ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ the question is more difficult. Wagn., reading ‘MASK MASK’ appeals to the deification of MASK or MASK . Henry replies that Virg. speaks of gods of the sea, but not of the sea itself as a god. The sea is called “MASK” below v. 849 in a passage somewhat similar to this: but such an analogy does not help us much. Admitting then that if the notion involved in ‘MASK’ would be satisfactorily supported, the word would be appropriate and poetical, I think this passage is one of the innumerable exceptions to the critical rule that the more difficult reading is to be preferred. Virg. may have thought of the Homerie MASK MASK , Od. 19. 260, 597., 23. 19.

19819481,aeneid_book5,Conington,"There is even more variety of opinion about ‘MASK MASK’ here than in v. 691 above. Heyne, who placed a semicolon after ‘MASK MASK’ seems to have regarded it as i. q. ‘MASK MASK’ to which Wagn. objects that the request which follows, so far from being an afterthought, is the main object of Venus' speech. This objection is not quite conclusive, as there might even be a dramatic propriety in the request so introduced. Venus has been carried on by her impetuosity into an enumeration of Juno's crimes, and now bethinks herself of what she wants to have done, at the same time that she may purposely adopt a phrase which rather disguises her anxiety about the main point. Such a defence however can hardly be urged against other views equally reconcilable with the language, and not requiring to be reconciled with the context. Henry understands it to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which would agree with the common interpretation of the words in v. 691, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” But Neptune's help was really worth far more to them than this, though it may again be replied that it suits Venus' purpose to extenuate the boon. Two other interpretations are mentioned by Wagn., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” or “MASK MASK” and “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The former brings the passage into conformity with what appears on the whole the best view of v. 691, at the same time that it supplies a subject for ‘MASK MASK’ which would otherwise perhaps be too obscure with ‘MASK’ following. Besides, the latter is open to one or two objections of its own: it is not suggested by the immediate context, which speaks of the burning of the ships, the Aeolian storm having been dismissed in v. 792: perhaps also it makes Venus assume too readily that their journey is near its end, as if distance and tempests had been the only causes of its prolongation. I think then that ‘MASK MASK’ is to be explained of the remaining ships and their crews, and that the probabilities of this interpretation here and in v. 691 may fairly be said to strengthen each other.","Quod superest , oro , liceat dare tuta per undas",796,1,,,

Donatus also read ‘MASK MASK’ reading too ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK’ and so making ‘MASK MASK MASK’ parenthetical. A further change, also sanctioned by some MSS. (e. g. Gud. a m. p.), would be to read ‘MASK MASK MASK’ but ‘MASK’ would then be an awkward and superfluous adjunct of ‘MASK MASK’ The proposal, revived by Bothe, to take ‘MASK MASK’ parenthetically, supplying ‘MASK’ to ‘MASK MASK’ and leaving ‘MASK’ to go with ‘MASK MASK’ had already been rejected with reason by Heyne as contrary to the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK’ Accepting the ordinary pointing as the only natural one, we cannot separate ‘MASK’ from ‘MASK MASK’ as Jahn still wishes to do; while on the other hand to understand ‘MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ with Heyne, Wagn., &c., seems scarcely natural. I would then regard it as one of the instances where Virg. has coupled by a copula two forms of expression not grammatically co-ordinate (see on 3. 329), ‘MASK MASK’ being equivalent to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK MASK’ to ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ As such it is rightly included by Wagn. in his Q. V. 34. 2, though with Heyne he gives to ‘MASK’ the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK’ In these cases Virg. generally contents himself with coupling two words, such as an adverb and an adjective: here he goes farther, so that we might almost class it with instances of the confusion of two constructions, were it not that here the two constructions are completed before they are forced into co-ordination. ‘MASK’ was restored by Wagn. from Med. and Rom. for ‘MASK MASK’ which is found in Pal. from a correction and in Gud., and is supported by Donatus and the Dresden Serv.",Aenean credam quid enim fallacibus auris,850,1,,,

Cic. Div. Verr. 11, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” where however another reading is ‘MASK’), and describes the waves as even then plashing among the rocks. ‘MASK’ is another instance (see on 3. 700, 704) of Virg. voluntarily or involuntarily separating the time he is writing of from the old heroic age.",Iamque adeo,864,1,,,

Serv. and Probus (quoted by Pomp. Sabinus) preserve a tradition, which Ribbeck follows, that Virg. added to this book vv. 1, 2 of Book 6, but that Tucca and Varius, or some one else (for the versions of the story vary) transferred them to their present place. The story is easily explained if we suppose with Conrads (see Introduction to this Book) that the present book is an afterthought, Virg. having originally intended to bring Aeneas direct from Carthage to Italy. In that case vv. 1, 2 of Book 6 really belong to the later draught, and in that sense are separable from the lines which they at present precede. As the poem now stands, no reader of taste will, I think, wish to disturb the arrangement of the ordinary editions, supplying as it does an affecting close to the book, which would be spoiled by carrying our thoughts on to Aeneas' safe arrival. The apparent abruptness of the opening of the next book, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is doubtless due to an imitation of the opening of Il. 7, Od. 13. In concluding Book 3 Virg. chose an opposite course: but his object there was precisely the contrary: he did not wish his readers to dwell on Aeneas' last words about the death of Anchises, and so purposely carried them farther, that they might end with a sense of repose.",Nudus et,871,1,,,

We must remember however that Ovid's business is to tell marvellous stories, and that the Sibyl's naturally came in as one of these. Henry is doubtless right in regarding the Sibyl's cave as the adytum of the temple of MASK, in opposition to Heyne and Wagn., who make the two independent and MASK some distance from each other. He cites the parallel instance of Delphi. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” he says, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” On the lower part of this hill, on one of the sides not next the sea, he places the sacred grove, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ on the sloping part of the hill a hypaethral temple, having the grove on both sides and in front: in the front sculptured doors: on the fourth or hinder side, consisting merely of the bare perpendicular rock of the hill, a number of other doors, leading into a vast cave in the substance of the rock. ‘MASK’ seems to point to the hilly position as well as to the height of the temple. “MASK MASK” 10. 875, where majesty seems the prominent notion.

But there is still a question, which Heyne states, as to the construction of ‘MASK MASK’—whether it means that Apollo breathes a mind and spirit into the Sibyl, or, as we should say, inspires her mind and spirit, i. e. with the knowledge of the future. If we adopt the latter, which Heyne prefers, we must take ‘MASK’ closely with ‘MASK MASK’ = ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK’ 4. 3 = ‘MASK MASK’ But though ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ is doubtless an admissible construction, the instances quoted by Forc. are both from later writers (“MASK MASK MASK” Quinct. 12. 10, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Justin 43. 1), while the conception of ‘MASK’ as a thing communicated is abundantly supported by such passages as 1. 304., 12. 554, MASK .",Mentem animumque,11,1,,,

Holdsworth and Spence (Miscellanea Virgiliana, pp. 207 foll.) distinguish between the priestess and the Sibyl, who they say, being a goddess, required some other person to introduce worshippers to her. But their distinction is not really borne out by Virg., who must have intended the same person in vv. 46 foll. and 77 foll., a patent fact which they are compelled to deny. The Sibyl is nowhere called a goddess by Virg., as in v. 258 ‘MASK’ is Hecate: she is called a priestess v. 321, as they admit. It is true, as they assert, that in Silius Italicus, Book 13, where Scipio goes down into the shades, he deals in the first instance not with the Sibyl, but with the priestess Autonoe: but Silius' Sibyl is not alive, but dead: she is like Homer's Tiresias, who drinks the blood of the victim, and then acquires the power of speech, and tells the visitor what he wishes to know. They object that Deiphobe the daughter of Glaucus was not the Sibyl's name; but there were several Sibyls, and the Cumaean Sibyl in particular had several names (Dict. Myth. ‘MASK’), so that Virg. may have followed some legend unknown to us, or may have thought himself at liberty to invent a name. On the whole subject see Heyne's Excursus.

The former is sufficiently supported by 10. 57, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” 1. 598, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” the latter has the analogy of ‘MASK’ in its favour, and is defended by such passages as 10. 555, 11. 87, MASK , and by ‘MASK’ 3. 162. The passage itself is perhaps rather in favour of the locative, as there would be a slight harshness in the omission of ‘MASK’ if it is intended to be closely constructed with ‘MASK MASK’ Yet it would be too hazardous to argue from the passages referred to that Virg. regarded ‘MASK’ as an actual locative like ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK’ as the ordinary sense of the dative can be traced more or less clearly in all three. The etymological history of a case is one thing, the manner in which it is likely to have been employed by a poet at a time when that history was forgotten or ignored, another. I think then that Wagn. and Forb. are right in their second thoughts, in regarding ‘MASK’ as a possessive gen.

It is paralleled however by a passage given in Forc. ‘MASK’ from Hirt. B. MASK , “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Some MSS., including a correction in Med., have ‘MASK’ after ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK’ The sentiment apparently is the common one that the path to death is easily trodden, and in fact must be trodden by all, but can rarely if ever be retraced. Aesch. expresses it in his way, Pers. 689, where the shade of Darius says MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK . Cerds quotes a Greek epigram, MASK MASK MASK MASK . Virg. makes use of the thought for his purpose here, though it does not seem very suitable. The difficulty is for a living man to make the journey; this, as we find afterwards, can only be surmounted by obtaining a passport of a particular kind (vv. 136 foll., 391 foll.): but when it has once been surmounted, the return does not appear to be less easy than any other part of the journey; at least we do not find that Aeneas had any obstacle to overcome (v. 898).

Possibly, as Peerlkamp thinks, he may have intended to make the forest easier of entrance than of exit: but in the subsequent description the forest is not made an obstacle at all: Aeneas goes through it under the guidance of the Sibyl without a hint of difficulty, and the only real bar is the passage of the river, which the possession of the bough enables him to overcome.

This however does not prove that cypresses were planted before funeral piles, while we know on other authority that they were used in making or dressing the piles. Serv. tells us from Varro that piles were surrounded with cypresses that the smell of the burning wood might overpower that of the burning body, and Stat. 9. 460., 5. 54, in passages apparently imitated from the present, makes the cypress used in the composition of the pile. (Sil. 10. 535 has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which may possibly support Cerda's view, as the cypresses are distinguished from other trees which would form a part of the pile: but the passage is too brief to build upon.) ‘MASK MASK’ will then refer to the laying down or perhaps setting upright of cypress trees or branches before the process indicated by ‘MASK’ takes place. Or Heyne may be right in taking ‘MASK’ locally, the pile being faced with trunks of cypresses.

If it has any special reference, it would probably be to ‘MASK MASK’ as Lersch understands it Antiqq. 9. § 86. Serv. however says “‘More parentum:’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” an explanation which may either mean that Virg. implies that the nearest male relatives officiated, or that Misenus' comrades took the part which would naturally have devolved on his parents.

MASK ): he refers to a Greek name G .3. 148 (a common habit with his master Lucr.): and the expression ‘MASK MASK MASK’ to which Wagn. objects, is found v. 441 below, as is observed by Forb. On the other hand the external evidence is such as to leave the question doubtful, so I have placed the line in brackets. There is a further question whether ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK’ ought to be read. The MSS. which retain the line would seem generally in favour of this latter, which I have adopted: but it would seem more likely that Virg. would use the Greek word than the Latin transformation of it, which hides the etymology. Is it certain that Lucr. in talking of the etymology of ‘MASK’ did not mean to derive it from “MASK”? Possibly however Virg. may have so far complied with the Latin form as to give ‘MASK’ the reading of Gud. and others, adopted by Heins.",unde locum Grai dixerunt nomine Aornon,242,1,,,

The same words however have already met us in MASK , where we cannot suppose that a sacrifice to the infernal gods is specially meant. All that is said is that the throat is cut from beneath, and this might be done equally well whether the victims' heads were turned up or down—more easily indeed in the former case. It is more probable that the special reference, if any, is to another (Roman?) sacrificial custom mentioned by Cerda in the same note, that of first striking the victims down with an axe or club, afterwards cutting their throats, a process which seems to have required two persons, according to a passage from Dionys.

So Od. 11. 35 Ulysses cuts the throats of the sheep into a trench, that the shades may flock round it. Virg. however seems to mean that the blood is caught in bowls that it may be afterwards poured out, apparently on the ground (3. 67., 5. 78).

But though Sleep regarded from one point of view is the restorer of nature, it is quite intelligible that it should be considered as itself a sign of the weakness which it remedies, at the same time that the suspension of consciousness, in which it resembles death, may naturally impress the imagination as an actual evil. That it is not fanciful to attribute such considerations to an ancient poet may be seen by comparing the Sophoclean MASK MASK MASK (Ant. 606), where the feeling is precisely the same, Sleep being regarded as an actual agent in human decay, though it has been lost on several of the later critics, who wish to alter the text. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ i. q. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” Sen.

Either of the two latter views seems probable. Virg. however has doubtless an object in placing the Furies on the threshold, which seems to have been their seat (see on v. 563 below), and there is something of the same inconsistency in his language about the Hydra, vv. 287, 576.

The words ‘MASK MASK’ (for ‘MASK’ see on 3. 591) sufficiently indicate the spectral and unsubstantial nature of the appearances, pointed out by the Sibyl in the following lines. Some of these monsters had been actually killed, so that it was natural that they should appear spectrally in Hades; others, like the Harpies, were products of the infernal world (comp. 3. 214), and though when appearing on earth they may have had bodies, they may be supposed to be divested of them in the shades, where spirit acts upon spirit. The train of thought may be the same as that in Hom. (Od. 11. 602), where though Hercules himself is among the gods, his MASK is in the shades (comp. Shelley's ‘MASK MASK MASK’ in the Prometheus Unbound): or Virg. may have been influenced more or less by a philosophical motive, intending to hint at the unreality of these terrible shapes.

Virg. conducts Aeneas over the water circumstantially, but from his description we should infer that there is only one river, which, after being called Acheron or Cocytus here, turns out eventually to be Styx, v. 385. Heyne remarks with justice (Excursus 9) that the poet would have found it awkward to have to describe the passage of all three, especially as Styx alone is said to surround the lower world nine times, v. 439. Generally we may say that Virg. found the notion of a single river of death most convenient for poetical purposes, but that he wished as usual to introduce the various points of the legends he followed, and so he employed the names Acheron, Cocytus, and Styx, whenever the river was to be spoken of, with a dim conception of Acheron as emptying itself into Cocytus, and perhaps of Styx as the most inward of the three, and a clear one of Phlegethon as specially surrounding Tartarus. Plato gives a much more definite description in his Phaedo, pp. 112, 113, speaking of four rivers, Ocean, Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, and Styx, the last of which disappears under the earth and reappears as Cocytus, an attempt apparently to realize the picture in Hom.: and later Roman poets, as Heyne observes, Exc. 9, have introduced varieties of their own.","Hinc via , Tartarei quae fert Acherontis ad undas",295,1,,,

If we take ‘MASK MASK’ in its ordinary sense, it may be modelled on the various uses of MASK in Hom. ‘MASK’ of plunging in doom vv. 512, 615. ‘MASK’ is specially used of untimely death, as in Cic. (?) De Domo Sua c. 16, quoted by Forc., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” like “MASK MASK”",abstulit atra dies et funere mersit acerbo,429,1,,,
43525333,aeneid_book6,Conington,"The meaning seems clear, that a separate place is assigned to those who have met their death by unjust condemnation. It has been asked why they should be made to suffer: but there is no suffering in this part of the shades; there is merely the absence of the enjoyment of life, the Homeric condition of the dead which Achilles declares to be worse than the lowest function on earth. That they should endure this is not unjust: the iniquity which dismissed them from life does not make their lives good or bad; that is decided by Minos, as we shall see immediately. We should expect however that they would not occupy this place permanently, but that on the rehearing of their case some would be despatched to Tartarus, others to Elysium. But Virg. does not say this, and if we compare the case of these persons with those of the infants and the suicides, we may doubt whether he intended it. Infants remain in their limbo apparently because they have had no opportunity of showing whether they were worthy of Elysium or of Tartarus; those who have cut short their own lives are not to be credited with the good or evil of their lives, but are consigned at once and for ever to a twilight condition like that imagined by Hom.: and so perhaps the victims of unjust sentences may be dealt with as those who having accidentally come into the state of death are exempted alike from reward and punishment. But we must not probe Virg.'s meaning too deeply: he has deserted the simplicity of Hom. for something far more complicated, and it is not surprising that in borrowing details from other sources he should have been led occasionally to combine inconsistencies. Warburton thought the reference here was to a story in Plato's Gorgias, pp. 523 foll., where the establishment of infernal judges is said to have been owing to the inequality of the sentences originally passed by living judges who had to decide the condition after death of those who were still in the body. Virg. may have thought of this: but his words are hardly reconcilable with it, as Warburton admits by his proposal to alter ‘MASK’ into ‘MASK MASK’ Virg. coincides with Plato in putting the place of judgment before the spot where the roads to Tartarus and Elysium diverge (vv. 540 foll.), and also in particularizing Minos, who according to Plato is a supreme judge of appeal, Asiatics being judged in the first instance by Rhadamanthus, Europeans by Aeacus. Virg. may also have thought of another passage in Plato, of which Cerda reminds us—that in the Apology, p. 41 B, where Socrates dwells on the pleasure of meeting in the shades those who, like himself, have died in consequence of an unjust sentence, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , such as Palamedes and the greater Ajax, though it is clear that if Plato had been asked where he intended to place these, he would have replied, in Elysium. There still remains a difficulty about the construction, as ‘MASK’ may be connected either with ‘MASK’ or with ‘MASK MASK’ Perhaps in the absence of any instance of ‘MASK MASK’=“MASK MASK” (comp. “MASK MASK MASK” “MASK MASK”), it will be safer to adopt the former, ‘MASK’ with the gen. of the punishment being sufficiently common (see Forc. s. v.).",hos iuxta falso damnati crimine mortis,430,1,,,
82913258,aeneid_book6,Conington,"seems to be used generally of the lower world, so that this and the two following lines will be virtually parenthetical. At the same time it would be too much to suppose that Virg. meant to commit himself to stating that the jurisdiction of Minos extended to all those who came down into the shades; we should rather infer, as was hinted in the last note, that some at least of those who died prematurely were left without any judgment at all, and consigned neither to Tartarus nor to Elysium. What the effect of this new judgment is on those on whom it is undoubtedly meant to operate, the falsely condemned, he has not told us, and perhaps he did not clearly realize himself. Meantime in this line, as in those that follow, he has introduced the phraseology of the Roman law, ‘MASK MASK’ apparently referring to the “MASK MASK MASK” the choice by lot of “MASK” for a particular case out of the whole judicial body. (The notion of Serv. and some early critics that the reference is to the drawing of lots to decide the order in which the causes should come on is far less likely.) In any case Minos is represented as ‘MASK MASK’ the name given to the presiding magistrate on a Roman criminal trial, who was assisted by the ‘MASK’ just mentioned. To say any thing definite about those who in the world below would answer to these ‘MASK’ would have been embarrassing to Virg., as, if Rhadamanthus and Aeacus were meant, they would hold their places without “MASK MASK” while it would not be easy to conceive of a judicial body among the shades themselves: so the poet as usual leaves the matter in obscurity. The pseudoAsconius however, commenting on Cic. Verr. Act. 1. 10, refers to this passage in the following words: “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ quaesitorem ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ urnam ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ consiliumque vocat : ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ vitasque et crimina discit . ’” But though ‘MASK’ is the technical term for the ‘MASK’ in relation to the presiding magistrate, and the word is found in Pal. and Gud. a m. p., the context is against it, as we should expect the ‘MASK’ to be the same as those whose ‘MASK MASK MASK’ are the subject of cognizance, though the position of ‘MASK’ does not necessarily prove this (see on G. 2. 119). Mr. Long suggests that the ‘MASK’ may consist of those who have been tried and pronounced innocent. On the whole it seems better to retain ‘MASK’ and refer it to the assemblage of those who are to be tried. Sen. H. F. 735 has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” an evident imitation of Virg., but not showing what he understood by “MASK MASK” though he goes on to mention Minos, Rhadamanthus , and Aeacus as judges in separate courts. ‘MASK MASK’ assigned to their occupants: the word however seems to have been chosen as associated with ‘MASK’ in the expression “MASK MASK MASK” which occurs 1. 139.",Hae sedes,431,1,,,

The meaning then will be that the gulf of Tartarus extends twice as far below the ground of the infernal regions which Aeneas and the Sibyl are traversing, as the heaven extends above the earth. To this explanation we are helped by the words of Hom. quoted on v. 577. We should have expected some mention of the earth, but Virg., writing with Hom. and Lucr. in his mind, was perhaps less likely to cultivate perfect clearness of expression, and he doubtless intended ‘MASK’ to be pressed, the earth being the only place from which a person could look up to heaven. This seems more likely than the view apparently held by Donatus and glanced at by Heyne, which would make the meaning to be that the depth of Tartarus below the infernal plains is as great as the height of heaven viewed, if it could be viewed, from the infernal plains; though there would be nothing harsh in thus slurring over ‘MASK MASK’ if we did not suppose Virg. to have the parallel of Hom. in his mind. Comp. MASK (note), where ‘MASK’ is used as loosely as ‘MASK’ would be according to this interpretation. A third view is mentioned by Forb. as Henry's, who however does not give it in his own note on this passage, viz. that ‘MASK MASK’ means the looking up from the floor of the sky to the highest point of Olympus, which he supposes to be meant by “MASK MASK” 1. 225. This view also would have much to recommend it, introducing as it does a striking comparison between the heights of heaven and the depths of the shades, but for the parallel in Hom.

He is called MASK in a fragment of Hesiod quoted by Schol. on Pind. p. 4. 252 (fragm. 32 Göttling). Joseph Warton thought that Virg. meant here to censure the Roman custom of deification, a supposition most unlikely in itself, and directly refuted by the whole tenor of the Aeneid, as well as by the Fourth and Fifth Eclogues and the end of the First Georgic. “MASK MASK” above v. 501.",Vidi et crudeles dantem Salmonea poenas,585,1,,,

Virg. may be said to have met this objection by introducing the circumstance of the imperishability of the liver, apparently from the story of Prometheus, as we shall see on v. 598: he has not however been quite consistent with himself, as v. 599 will show. ‘MASK’ ‘MASK’ is the reading a m. p. of Med. and fragm.

Hom. affords no help, as his words are MASK MASK MASK , unless it should be contended that ‘MASK’ is a translation, an awkward one at best, of MASK . Still though ‘MASK’ appears to be Virg.'s word, it may be doubted whether he would not have done more wisely in following Hom. more closely, as it detracts from the grandeur of Tityos' descent as one of the earthborn to intimate in the same breath that the earth is the mother of all. ‘MASK’ expresses the relation of a child to the nurse rather than to the mother; but the two lie so near together that they are often identified.

Vat.; but though it might be used of pecking, it would be far too weak for a context like this. ‘MASK MASK’ might be i. q. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ (so Serv.); but it is better to make ‘MASK’ abl. (comp. “MASK MASK MASK” MASK ), the punishment being conceived of as growing along with the materials of punishment. Cerda reminds us appropriately that the liver was regarded by the ancients as the seat of passion, so that Tityos, the ravisher, is suitably punished: Lucr. however has not taken advantage of this in moralizing the legend, not mentioning the liver even in his description of Tityos' sufferings.",immortale iecur tondens fecundaque poenis,598,1,,,

It is as if the reader were allowed a glimpse of that fearful abyss, and, after distinguishing a few figures, were to find himself unable to disentangle his impressions of the sufferers and their torments, and so obliged to retire with a confused sense of terrors inextricably blended. Ixion and Pirithous stand for the whole class of hitherto unnamed criminals: the tortures which follow are chosen not as those which the persons specified individually suffered, but as belonging to some of the number. In this again there is a dramatic and poetical propriety, at the same time that the confusion is justified by the fact that the legends on which Virg. had to build were not always accordant in their accounts,—Hom. e. g. representing Tantalus as tormented with perpetual hunger and thirst (Od. 11. 582 foll.), while Pindar (Olymp. 1. 55 foll.) and Lucr. (3. 980) make him the victim of the everthreatening stone mentioned in the next line. Thus ‘MASK’ is regularly constructed after ‘MASK MASK MASK’ as its antecedent. “MASK MASK” v. 123 above. Comp.

40387871,aeneid_book6,Conington,"but though the mention of Megaera and the word ‘MASK’ show that Stat. had this passage of Virg. in his mind, the banquet he is thinking of is the banquet which Tantalus served up of his child's flesh, supposed to be repeated in the lower world, so that we cannot argue from the imitation to the right interpretation of the passage imitated. On the other hand, the two punishments are not easily combined in thought, the point of the terror of the overhanging rock being that it distracts the victim's mind from any thing else, while the banquet is represented as rendered impossible, not by the alarm of the rock, but by the interference of the Fury. If the view taken on v. 601 is the correct one, there is of course a further reason for supposing more than one punishment to be spoken of. On the whole then I think that two punishments are named, and those only as specimens of an infinite number. The hint of the banquet is evidently given by the Homeric description of Tantalus, but the circumstances are varied with considerable judgment, the board spread with artificial dainties being substituted for the simpler features of lake-water and orchard-trees. In Val. Fl. 2. 192 foll. Theseus and Phlegyas are represented as doomed to sit at a similar banquet, the poet having either followed another legend, or availed himself of Virg.'s example to introduce changes of his own. ‘MASK MASK’ are entirely different from the ‘MASK MASK’ or bridal bed, though both receive their name from the genius, the deification of the happier and more impulsive part of man (see on MASK ). ‘MASK MASK’ is a feast-day, and so ‘MASK MASK’ is a banqueting couch, whether the expression is Virg.'s own or borrowed from common language. ‘MASK MASK’ so “MASK MASK MASK” 2. 2. The second epithet is rather awkward, but it is doubtless to be explained with Wagn. on 5. 24 by saying that ‘MASK MASK’ forms one notion, and that ‘MASK’ is added as a piece of ornamental description.",imminet adsimilis ; lucent genialibus altis,603,1,,,

Andromacha fr. 9 Vahlen has “MASK MASK MASK MASK” so that the adj. was probably one of the many compound epithets invented by the old poets, who, like their Greek predecessors, frequently cared only for one part of the compound, ‘MASK’ being regarded as = ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK’ was found to be virtually convertible with ‘MASK MASK’ “MASK MASK” 1. 637. ‘MASK MASK’ is explained as a personification of Hunger by Serv., who refers to 3. 252, where the same words occur; but though Celaeno with her Prophecy of Famine illustrates and is illustrated by the office of the fiend here, there is no reason to suppose that the expression has any other but its ordinary sense, one of the Furies, conceived of as the eldest of the sisterhood, being charged with the execution of this mode of punishment. MASK MASK occurs Eur. Iph. T. 963. If we suppose Virg. to have thought of three Furies, we may suppose this to be either Allecto or Megaera, Tisiphone, as we have seen v. 555, being otherwise employed.

Doubtless Virg. had in his mind the civil wars of Rome , ‘MASK’ having that special reference, as in MASK , though in MASK it seems general. Augustus would of course not be likely to regard himself as glanced at, as some of the commentators have feared that he might, since he doubtless considered his own mission to be that of putting an end to such impious conflicts. Wagn. ingeniously supposes the servile wars to be meant, connecting ‘MASK MASK MASK’ closely with the preceding clause; but the two images do not seem as if they were meant to harmonize, and there is a point gained in supposing two classes of violators of relative duties to be intended rather than one.

But whether in this line Orpheus is intended to produce the notes with his voice in singing, or with the lyre as he plays, is not clear. ‘MASK’ seems as if it may be intended to translate MASK , in the sense of ‘MASK’ as though the verb in Greek does not appear to be technically applied to music, MASK is used in Aristot.

Cerda traces it in the Greek philosophers, including Plato. ‘MASK’ = ‘MASK MASK’ as Henry observes, though he is hypercritical in condemning Heyne'sexplanation ‘MASK MASK’ which was doubtless meant, not as a lexicographical explanation, but merely as a substantial equivalent in the present context.",Hinc,733,1,,,
17607046,aeneid_book6,Conington,"In the small text of Virg. I had recalled ‘MASK’ with Henry, supposing it to be the reading of Pal.; but it is found only in two of Ribbeck's cursives and there from a correction, in inferior copies mentioned by Wagn., in the MSS. of Donatus, and in some copies of Serv. Thus the weight of authority is decidedly in favour of ‘MASK MASK’ which is actually found in Gud. a m. p. and some later copies, and is really supported by all those (Med., fragm. Vat., Rom., Pal., &c.) which read ‘MASK MASK’ See on 1. 211, MASK , 354 &c. ‘MASK’ is specially used of looking through darkness or seeing after blindness, as in MASK (which Virg. may have had in his mind), Cic. Fin. 4. 23, Suet. Ner. 19.

Where the mistake is at once so easy and so commonly made, it is clearly one which may be corrected without the help of MSS., from a simple consideration of the requirements of the case.

He shows that MASK and ‘MASK’ were specially used in that sense (comp. St. Paul's application of MASK MASK MASK Gal. 3. 13 to crucifixion, the primary reference of the words being different, as is remarked by Ellicott in loco), and argues that ‘MASK’ points the same way. But it signifies little what was the precise image Virg. had before his mind, the real point being that the spirit is hung up in such a way as to secure its purification by air. Serv. refers to the ‘MASK’ in the festival of Bacchus ( MASK note, where the parallel is mentioned by anticipation): but Gossrau remarks that no one but Serv. seems to have connected these with purification, and that other traditional notices of them explain them differently. “MASK MASK” 10. 82. Henry ingeniously makes ‘MASK’ here the nom., supposing the meaning to be that the winds blow through the unsubstantial forms of the spirits: there would however be something awkward in the predicative epithet here, when we have already to connect ‘MASK’ closely with ‘MASK MASK’ and it is possible that the same meaning may be intended by the application of the epithet to the winds, which being thin and unsubstantial, are conceived of as the more penetrating. Notices of this threefold purification are cited by Cerda from Martianus Capella and St. Augustin: but it is not clear that they, any more than Serv., had any further authority for the custom than the present passage of Virg.",Supplicia expendunt,740,1,,,

Gossrau understands it in the former sense, making ‘MASK MASK’ = ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ But this is hardly Virgilian, and is not sufficiently supported by 12. 242, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” On the other hand it is certainly harsh to understand ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ but it seems not unlike Virg., and is perhaps justified by such inversions as 4. 477 note. For passive participles in Greek which may be explained on the principle of the cognate acc. see my note on Aesch. Choeph. 806. The force of ‘MASK’ is well illustrated by Forb. from Sen. Ep. 59, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” No other instance is quoted of ‘MASK’ in the sense of being removed by burning (for in MASK and Cic. de Div. 3. 3 the sense or reading seems more than doubtful): but such a use of the compound is abundantly defended from analogy, e. g. ‘MASK’ which just preceded, and “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Cic. Planc. 4.",Infectum,742,1,,,
13024007,aeneid_book6,Conington,"These lines are among the hardest in Virg. The first sentence ‘MASK MASK MASK’ has puzzled the commentators perhaps more than it would have done had they sufficiently remembered Virg.'s fondness for artificial phrases. The general meaning evidently is ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ This Virg. has apparently chosen to express by saying ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ the Manes, which appear to have been a sort of twofold genius belonging to each person (see on 4. 610), being regarded as separable from the person himself, and as subjecting him to inflictions: at the same time that Virg. probably intended to avail himself of other possible constructions, the cognate accusative, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ and the accusative of definition, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The suggestion that the Genius is meant is made by Serv., but it seems better not to regard it as exhausting the meaning of the passage, as the Manes or Genius elsewhere appear to stand for the deified individual, and their visitations, as in 4. 610, take effect not on the individual himself but on his enemies. We are also helped by the consideration that elsewhere in Virg. the infernal powers are spoken of loosely as ‘MASK’ (10. 39., 12. 646, MASK , 505), though it would be too much to infer from this with Cerda and others that ‘MASK’ here simply = ‘MASK’ if it were only that the words so interpreted would be open to the objection made in the last sentence, the Furies of a person generally meaning not the Furies that punish a person, but those which, being his embodied curses, punish his enemies (see on 4. 384). It is true that there is a distinct instance where ‘MASK’ appears to be used for spiritual punishment, Stat. Theb. 8. 84, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but this proves no more than that Stat. there as elsewhere ventured on an experiment in language in imitation, as he thought, of Virg. Professor Munro, Journal of Philology, vol. 2, pp. 145, 146 says, “‘ Quisque suos patimur Manis ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘we put on, bear the burden, each one of us good or bad, of his own manes or garb of death,’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ Donator atrae lucis , Alcide , tuum Diti remitte munus , ereptos mihi Restitue manis : inpius frustra invoco Mortem relictam . ’” The difficulty of what follows is greater. The words are easy, but it is not easy to see the appropriateness of the sentence to the context. As they stand, they appear to speak of a second purgation as going on in Elysium, which is in itself not a very likely thing, while the change of person from ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ to ‘MASK’ v. 750 has still to be accounted for. Jahn, whose explanation is approved by Forb., supposes that all the shades are sent into Elysium after their purgation, but that while the greater part only pass through on their way to Lethe, a few, of whom Anchises is one, are allowed to remain there and complete a still higher purification, as a prelude to a new and glorious life on earth. This is probably as plausible an explanation as is likely to be suggested of the passage as it stands, but the inconsistencies of it lie on the surface. Elysium, as has been said above, is not a natural place for purgation; it is evidently the everlasting reward of a good life, not a place of temporary sojourn previous to a return to earth: there is nothing in vv. 741, 742, as compared with vv. 745—747, to show that the degree of purification contemplated in the latter is intended to be higher than that in the former: the ‘MASK MASK’ of v. 748 are plainly parallel to the ‘MASK MASK’ of v. 745; and it can hardly be meant that the more highly purified spirits return to earth without a draught of Lethe. A general view of the context seems to require, as Heyne and some of the early editors, and more lately Henry, have seen, that the souls which are purified and sent back to earth should be distinguished from the select few who are purified and established in Elysium, and this the change of person decidedly favours. The words ‘MASK MASK MASK’ then, if not the previous clause, will refer to the latter, the whole of the following lines to the former, who, as being far the larger number, are spoken of as if they were the whole body. But this sense, though required by the context and favoured by the language, does not suit the order of the passage. Heyne and his contemporaries wished to get rid of the difficulty by transposing the two lines before us, which is Ribbeck's remedy; Henry thinks they are no more than an ordinary Virgilian parenthesis. The first suggestion appears to me as much too violent as the second is too lenient. The supposition of a confusion of the order introduced by the transcribers is at all times hazardous (see on MASK —205), and is exposed to unusual suspicion here, as the lines would still look awkward if placed, where alone they could be placed, after v. 747, so that Heyne inclines to treat them as altogether spurious; while on the other hand, if Virg. intended no more than an ordinary parenthesis, it must be admitted that his sentence is exceedingly ill constructed. I think then that every thing points to the supposition, which at one time occurred to Heyne himself, that we have here one of the passages in the Aeneid (the case of the Georgics is different: see on MASK —205) which Virg. left unfinished. His whole conception of a metempsychosis seems, as I have said in the prefatory remarks to this book, to be really inconsistent with the general picture which he gives of the world of spirits, and so he naturally found a difficulty in harmonizing the two in Anchises' narrative. Had the Aeneid been a finished poem, the obstacle would doubtless have been surmounted so far as the mechanical structure of the present passage is concerned, but we should have felt it nevertheless in reading the Sixth Book. A doubt still remains whether ‘MASK’ refers to the whole body of the departed, as ‘MASK’ evidently does, or to the few spoken of in the next clause. In the one case the meaning will be that the whole multitude is sent through Elysium, the greater part to drink the Lethe water and then return to life, the few to remain in Elysium: in the other, that the few are distributed among the spacious plains, a use of ‘MASK’ for which see on 1. 680. On the whole the former view seems to agree best with the language of these two lines, while any objection which may be raised to it from the language of vv. 748 foll., where Lethe seems to be introduced for the first time, is obviated by the consideration mentioned above, that the present passage as left by Virg. is not meant to cohere with the context. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK MASK” 1. 538.",,"743,744",0,,,

L. 9. 38),—or born after the father's last will (Gaius Inst. 1. 147, Ulpian Dig. 26. 2, 5, referred to by Freund s. v.: see Dict. A. “MASK MASK” Roman). Here it evidently has its original meaning, as Caesellius Vindex ap. Gell. 2. 16 long ago remarked, though Serv. and in later times even Henry and Sir G. Lewis give it the sense of ‘MASK’ contrary to the plain meaning of the next line. Virg. seems to have intended to translate the Homeric MASK , as the commentators remark. The word appears to be restricted to children, till we come to writers like Apuleius and Tertullian, who use it as convertible with ‘MASK MASK’ In the legendary accounts Silvius seems actually to have been called Silvius Postumus : see Lewis, Credibility, vol. 1, pp. 357 foll.",Albanum nomen,763,1,,,
49251101,aeneid_book6,Conington,"The story, as told by Serv. here and on 1. 270 and others (Lewis, p. 356), is that MASK was left pregnant at Aeneas' death, when, fearing Ascanius, she took refuge in the woods, and there brought forth Silvius; after which an arrangement, variously related, was made, by which Lavinium was left to MASK, and Ascanius founded Alba. In the latter kingdom Silvius eventually succeeded Ascanius, either in default of heirs, or because the actual heir, named Iulus, was too young. Some made Silvius the son of Ascanius, and so Livy 1. 4, who speaks of him as “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Virg. apparently adopts the tradition generally, without thinking it necessary to specify the circumstances of Silvius' birth in the woods, while he indirectly contradicts the story of MASK's fear of Ascanius, which would have jarred on all readers of the Aeneid, by representing Silvius as born in his father's lifetime. The legends of the sequel of Aeneas' life after his settlement in Latium are not altogether reconcilable with the treatment adopted by Virg. in the Aeneid. Virg. doubtless could have harmonized them with his purpose, had he pleased, as skilfully as he has harmonized discordant materials in the story of the Aeneid itself: but he has chosen instead to regard them from a distance, without distinctly committing himself to any one version of them. Even thus however he has not been able to escape some inconsistencies, as the present passage shows, compared with that in the First Book. There (1. 265 foll.) we are told by implication that Aeneas' death and deification takes place three years after his landing in Latium: here he is spoken of as living to old age, a time which must have been conceived of by Virg. as long subsequent to that in which he captivated Dido: there the name of Ascanius is associated with Alba, here that of Silvius. These statements, it is true, may be brought into agreement by supposing that Aeneas reigns at Lavinium after the expiration of three years in camp, Ascanius removing to Alba after his death, and that Silvius is mentioned here simply as the successor of Ascanius at Alba ; but it seems hardly likely that Virg. should have formed a definite and, in one respect at least, independent conception of events which he alludes to so cursorily. With ‘MASK’ Germ. comp. Evander's words to Pallas, 8. 581, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” This is the first mention of the name of Aeneas' destined wife, who has been already alluded to 2. 783., 6. 93. Serv. curiously reconciles ‘MASK’ with the posthumous birth of Silvius by understanding it of the immortal life of the deified Aeneas, as the Greeks call the gods MASK . Henry supposes ‘MASK MASK’ merely to mean that the child was conceived in Aeneas' old age.",quem tibi longaevo serum Lavinia coniunx,764,1,,,

Perhaps on a comparison of 7. 763 we may say that Virg. meant to glance at both meanings (comp. also the association of MASK and MASK in Greek tragedy), though in v. 779 it can hardly be meant that Ilia reared as well as bore Romulus. With ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ comp. 9. 642, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Virg. doubtless intended a contrast between the place of Silvius' birth and his high destiny, whatever his view of the story may have been.",Educet,765,1,,,

Other accounts put him fourteenth in a list of sixteen: see Lewis, pp. 360 foll., where it appears further that some omitted him altogether. What MASK did to entitle him to the name of ‘MASK MASK MASK’ does not seem to appear from any extant legend. Ov. M. 14. 622 places the story of Vertumnus and Pomona under his reign.","“ Proxumus ille Procas , Troianae gloria gentis",767,1,,,
17087985,aeneid_book6,Conington,"MASK comes before Procas in other lists: according to Serv. he is sixth, according to others eighth or ninth. Anchises naturally mentions him as bearing the name of his own father. MASK follows Procas immediately in other lists. For his story see Lewis l. c. and Dict. M. Virg. is the first author cited for this use of ‘MASK’ like ‘MASK’ (comp. 4. 329., 12. 348), which is common in post-Augustan poetry and prose: see Freund. Rom. has ‘MASK MASK’ which might be supported from 1. 20., 287, in which passages, as in Enn.

The words ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ might seem merely to refer to the general contingency to which all these potential personages are subject: comp. v. 828, and see on v. 780: Serv. however explains it by saying that MASK MASK was kept out of his kingdom for fifty-three years by an usurping guardian. Sir G. Lewis rightly remarks that Serv.'s story is inconsistent with Dionysius and others, who assign to this king a reign of thirtyone years: but it is not clear why he should assume that Virg.'s expression cannot be reconciled with the supposition of a long reign, as the uncertainty affects his coming to the throne at all, and apparently ceases after his accession, and the words ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ in effect imply that his reign was a glorious one. ‘MASK’ is generally found with ‘MASK MASK’ here it is naturally enough used with ‘MASK MASK’ which, as Madv. § 436 remarks, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ “MASK MASK MASK MASK” above v. 403. ‘MASK’ 3. 14.","Silvius Aeneas , pariter pietate vel armis",769,1,,,

Quantas ostentant , aspice , vires",771,2,,,
47225565,aeneid_book6,Conington,"Heyne, following many of the old editions and one MS., read ‘MASK MASK’ connecting the line with what follows and supposing a difference to be made between those who are famed in war and those who are famed in peace. But this interpretation ignores the nature of the ‘MASK MASK’ which was given for preserving the life of a citizen in war and slaying an enemy, so that this line contains no contrast to the preceding, but only a specification and a climax (see Dict. A. ‘MASK’). ‘MASK MASK’ see on 1. 567. The expression was doubtless originally a piece of mere simplicity, a person being supposed to carry his limbs or at least the upper parts of his body as he might carry any thing separate from him: but in using it here Virg. may have thought of carrying the umbrageous wreath on the forehead, as conceivably MASK may have intended to indicate the feeling of weight and oppression in the head and eyes. ‘MASK’ like “MASK MASK MASK MASK” 8. 276. The civic wreath was originally given only to those who distinguished themselves in hand to hand combat: like other ancient honours however it was voted by the senate to Augustus, who had oaken wreaths hung before his doors as being the perpetual preserver of the citizens. Gossrau, from whom this is taken, refers to Ov. F. 1. 614., 4. 953.

Romulus is already marked as a child of upper air (comp. “MASK MASK” v. 568 above) by his father's token, the twocrested helmet. The reference apparently is to the contingency which more or less overshadows all who are in this state of potential existence (note on v. 769), and which Romulus by favour of his future father Mars has in fact already overcome. Henry's objection, that ‘MASK MASK’ in Virg. is restricted to Jupiter, is met by observing that ‘MASK’ here belongs not so much to ‘MASK’ as to ‘MASK MASK’ That the two-crested helmet was distinctive of Mars is, as Henry says, made probable by Val. Max. 1. 8, § 6, taken in conjunction with this passage, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Heyne remarks that Romulus is constantly represented with a helmet. ‘MASK’ can only refer to ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK’ shows. The only difficulty is in the use of ‘MASK’ in the singular in the sense which, as we have seen, it bears in the plural; but this is not invincible (comp. its application to things vv. 128, 680), and certainly need not lead us to construct ‘MASK’ as gen. pl. with either ‘MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK’ to the detriment of the general sense, though it may make us see some plausibility in Peerlkamp's conj. ‘MASK MASK’ which in an author less well supported by MSS. authority might itself be confused with ‘MASK MASK’ especially with ‘MASK’ preceding.

74268201,aeneid_book6,Conington,"This second ‘MASK’ has been variously identified. Hyginus, quoted by Gell. 10. 16, assumed that Mummius was still intended, and accused Virg. of confounding two distinct events, Mummius' campaign and the war with Pyrrhus, whom he supposes to be intended by ‘MASK MASK’ his conclusion being that Virg. would doubtless have altered the passage had he lived, and that if v. 839 were excluded, all would be right. Gossrau still pleads for Mummius, contending with considerable ingenuity that Anchises in the preceding couplet has expressed himself in Roman imagery, and now repeats his meaning in words more intelligible to Aeneas, who knew nothing of Corinth or the Capitol, and would only conceive of the conquest of Greece as a victory over the descendants of Achilles or the destruction of the empire of Agamemnon. But Anchises is not elsewhere so considerate to his son's ignorance, referring as he does throughout to Roman exploits in Roman language: nor is it credible that ‘MASK MASK’ should have been used not for an individual but for the descendants of Achilles generally. The argument that if ‘MASK’ &c. v. 840 be referred to any one but Mummius, Virg. virtually denies that Mummius did execute this revenge, needs no refutation. So far as the language is concerned, it would certainly seem that the second ‘MASK’ denotes a different person from the first. The most probable candidate for this honour appears to be L. Aemilius Paullus , the conqueror of Macedon, v. 839 being understood of his victory over Perseus, who is said by Prop. 5. 11. 39, Sil. 15. 291 (speaking of his father Philip) to have been a descendant of Achilles; though there still remains a difficulty, as Paullus was not the destroyer of MASK and Mycenae. We must suppose then that Virg. has written loosely, perhaps conceiving that the indefinite ‘MASK MASK MASK’ exempted him from the need of strict accuracy. Heyne suggests that ‘MASK MASK’ may refer to Paullus' cruel destruction of the Epirots, supposed to be represented by their ancestor Pyrrhus (agreeably to the well-known line of Ennius, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ann. 6. fr. 7): but this is far less likely.

But Virg.'s concession is made in a liberal and magnificent spirit, in order that the real fame of his countrymen as warriors and statesmen may appear greater: and it is not likely that he thought of the number of individual reputations that the position thus assumed compelled him to sacrifice. In the general proposition, that the real greatness of Rome lay in acts of war and policy, all moderns will agree with him: and whether he has specified oratory among the pursuits in which other nations are allowed to excel or has left it to be inferred is a matter of little consequence. He would doubtless have specified poetry with equal or greater readiness, if he had not felt that the very mention of it would have implied a latent egotism. ‘MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK” MASK , though there the addition of “MASK MASK” softens the expression.

Here then it might possibly be taken with Serv. &c. in the sense of ‘MASK MASK’ It is to be observed however that Virg. elsewhere uses the word in connexion with size (2. 15., 3. 637., 7. 707), so that I would rather suppose the meaning to be, with Heyne, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which is besides suggested by the context. ‘MASK’ is evidently meant to distinguish him from those about him, so that we should expect some attribute of distinction to be predicated of him, not simple similarity to his ancestor.

Both may be illustrated from the dreams of Hom.: in Od. 4. 796 the apparition of Iphthime is made by Athene: in Il. 2. 6 foll. the Dream-god is sent to give false counsel.

Heyne read ‘MASK’ from three or four inferior MSS., to avoid the repetition of ‘MASK’ in the same part of the next verse: but though the repetition is certainly awkward, it seems better to suppose a slight carelessness on Virg.'s part than to question the reading of all the great MSS. Ribbeck cuts the knot by bracketing v. 901, which is repeated from 3. 277. Perhaps we may say that Virg. inserted it as a piece of his own epic common-place, whether as a stop-gap or not, and that this accounts for the repetition of ‘MASK MASK’ The mention of Caieta has been objected to, as inconsistent with the opening of the next Book, where it is said that the death of Caieta, Aeneas ' nurse, was the occasion of the name.
