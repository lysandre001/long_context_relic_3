05287244,aeneid_book1,Conington,"This line is preceded in some MSS. by the following verses, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” They are not found in Med., Rom., Gud., or the Verona fragments (Pal. and the fragments of Vat. and St. Gall seem to fail here), and the only MS. in Ribbeck's list which contains them (the Berne MS. No. 172) has them written in the margin by a later hand. They appear to have existed in the time of Servius and of the Pseudo-Donatus, who say that Nisus the grammarian had heard a story of their having been expunged by Tueca and Varius; on which Heyne remarks, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The external evidence of such a story it is impossible to estimate, but its existence suspiciously indicates that the lines were felt to require apology. Those who speak of them as an introduction to the poem, forget that if genuine they are an integral part of the first sentence; and that it is, to say the least, remarkable that the exordium should be so constructed as to be at once interwoven with the context, and yet capable of removal without detriment to the construction, just at the point which forms a much better commencement. The words ‘MASK MASK’ are quoted by Martial, 8. 56., 19. 14., 185. 2, and Auson. Epig. 137. 1, evidently as a real commencement of the Aeneid; while Ovid, Trist. 2. 533, and Persius, 1. 96, quote ‘MASK MASK MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK MASK’ as important and independent words, which they cease to be the moment ‘MASK’ is viewed in connexion with the words supposed to precede it. Virg. himself, 9. 777, has (of the poet Clytins) “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Comp. also MASK , Prop. 3. 26. 63, which point the same way. Macrob. Sat. 5. 2. quotes ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as part of the first verse of the Aeneid. On the other hand Priscian 910 P cites ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as Virg.'s. Henry's view that ‘MASK MASK’ is happily contrasted with ‘MASK MASK’ (comp. MASK ) seems to be favoured by the structure of the sentence, and may very possibly have been present to the mind of the author of these lines; but it clearly was not present to the minds of those who quoted ‘MASK’ by itself as war . Tastes may differ as to the rival commencements, on which see Henry in loco, and on 2. 247; but it may be suggested that Virg. would scarcely in his first sentence have divided the attention of the reader between himself and his hero by saying, in effect, that the poet who wrote the Eclogues and the Georgics, sings the hero who founded Rome . Wagn. and Forb., however, as well as Henry, consider the lines as genuine; and they have been imitated by Spenser in the opening of the Faery Queene, and Milton in the opening of Paradise Regained.",,1,0,,,

It may also be taken from the first line of the Cyclic poem of the Epigoni, preserved by the Schol. on MASK , MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK . It is followed by all the other Roman writers of epic poetry, Lucan, Flaccus, Statius, and, above all, Silius, the most faithful copier of Virg., with a unanimity which strongly supports the view taken in the preceding note. The words are not a hendiadys, but give first the character of the subject and then the subject itself. ‘MASK’ may have been intended to suggest, though it does not express, a contrast between this and Virg.'s previous poems.—In commencing with ‘MASK’ he has followed his own example in the Georgics, rather than that of Homer, who at once invokes the Muse; and the Latin Epic writers have followed Virg. The earlier commentators have found a difficulty in reconciling ‘MASK’ with Antenor's previous migration (below, vv. 242 foll.), and suggest that Aeneas had first reached Italy proper, though Antenor had previously reached Venetia. On the other hand, Heyne and Wagn. make ‘MASK’ equivalent to ‘MASK MASK’ thus weakening a word which from its position and its occurrence in the first line of the poem must be emphatic. The more obvious sense is that Aeneas is so called without reference to Antenor, as the founder of the great Trojan empire in Italy.",,1,0,,,

The MSS. are divided between ‘MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ and perhaps ‘MASK MASK’ The last, however, though adopted by Burm. and Heyne, and approved by Heins., seems to rest solely on the authority of Med., which has ‘MASK’ (corrected into ‘MASK’), with a mark of erasure after the word. ‘MASK’ is found in the Verona fragm., and is supported by quotations in Terentianus Maurus and Diomedes, and in single MSS. of Priscian, Censorinus, and Servius in artem Donati. ‘MASK’ is found in Rom., Gud., and probably most other MSS., and is supported by quotations in Macrobius, Gellius, Marius Victorinus, Pompeius, the Schol. on Lucan, most MSS. of Priscian, and one of Censorinus. Servius mentions both readings, saying, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ is supported by 4. 236: but the synizesis, though not unexampled (comp. 5. 269., 6. 33, and see on MASK ), is perhaps awkward, especially in the second line of the poem, and the imitation in Prop. 3. 26. 64, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” is in favour of the form ‘MASK’ Juv. 12. 71 has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” though there as in Prop. the quadrisyllabic form might be introduced and explained by synizesis. On the whole, I have preferred ‘MASK’ believing the form to be possible in itself (comp. “MASK MASK” “MASK MASK” “MASK” &c.), and more probable in this instance; the modern editors however are generally for ‘MASK MASK’ Lachmann on MASK speaks doubtfully.

Others make ‘MASK’ nearly equivalent to ‘MASK MASK’ citing 2. 123, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but even supposing that ‘MASK’ in this sense might be taken distributively, which the passage above quoted does not prove, ‘MASK’ would scarcely be appropriate to ‘MASK’ in this sense, while the words frequently occur in conjunction in the sense of outraged majesty.

Thus the negative answer to ‘MASK MASK MASK’ would be “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Or we may say that ‘MASK MASK’ alone would stand for “MASK MASK” (see Madv. § 426), and that in such a construction the question could hardly be asked otherwise than by making the interrogative pronoun agree with the noun.

On the whole however it seems more likely that Aeneas, who has as yet seen no one, should ask first a general question about the safety of the city, and then a special one about the citadel, so that after much hesitation I follow Henry in returning to the common view. “MASK” is used in its proper sense, a citadel, or point of defence, though ‘MASK’ seems to show that the word is not meant to be restricted to the citadel MASK MASK , Pergamus, as Wagn.'s interpretation of ‘MASK’ for “MASK” would not yield an appropriate sense. Aeneas sees Panthus hurrying away from the citadel with his gods and his grandson, and so naturally asks, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK MASK’ suspecting already that Pergamus is no longer tenable. Henry well remarks that Panthus answers in effect, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ and that Aeneas, hearing this, rushes out with no definite object in the direction of the shouting. ‘MASK MASK’ 6. 61.",,322,0,,,

The external evidence against its genuineness is strong, stronger than against the genuineness of the former passage, the MSS. which contain the lines now in question being very few, and apparently none of them of great importance. The early interpreters do not comment on them, though their existence is recognized by a doubtful notice in Serv., which is the chief authority for the Tucca and Varius story. But when we come to internal considerations, the case is altered. The lines, though possibly disfigured by a few harshnesses, are vigorous and elaborate, and in general worthy of Virg. They are perhaps not required by the context, as v. 601 might be explained without them, and the appearance of Venus could be accounted for by supposing with Donatus that Aeneas was meditating suicide; but the context is improved by their presence, and v. 589, as Wagn. has pointed out, coheres rather awkwardly with v. 566. The aesthetical or ethical objection that has been taken to them, as if Virg. would not have made his hero think of killing a woman in a temple, seems to belong to a later age (see on v. 583), nor need the discrepancy between the present account of Helen and what we read 6. 510 foll. about her introducing the Greeks to the chamber of Deiphobus disturb us much, at the same time that one or both reasons may have led to their exclusion on critical grounds, whether by Tucca and Varius, or by some less authorized regulator of Virg.'s text. The external evidence however seems to me too formidably strong to be summarily ignored, so that I have followed the earlier editors, who enclose the passage in brackets, rather than the bulk of the later, who print it as an unquestioned part of the text.

39074296,aeneid_book2,Conington,"It is not easy to say whether ‘MASK’ is to be taken with Cerda and most of the later commentators of a pointed tongue of flame, or with Henry of the crown or topmost point (a tuft of hair, as he suggests with reference to ‘MASK’) of Ascanius' head. The latter would be supported by 10. 270, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” the ‘MASK’ there being the crest of the helmet which Aeneas happened to be wearing: the former has the authority of Ovid, who three times (F. 6. 636, M. 10. 279, Pont. 4. 9. 54) uses ‘MASK’ of a point or spire of flame, and agrees with Val. Fl. 3. 188, where “MASK MASK” seems to mean a luminous halo or star on the brow of Castor. This evidence in favour of a special use is to a certain extent confirmed by the language of the present passage, by the epithet ‘MASK’ and the words ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which do not agree equally well with Henry's view, as in that case ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ could hardly be separated. The tautology between ‘MASK MASK MASK’ (as explained of the flame) and ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ of which he complains, is not unVirgilian. It is singular that there should be two passages in later poets, one (Claud. 4 Cons. Hon. 192 foll.) alluding to, the other (Sil. 16. 119 foll.) modelled on, the present, in both of which the same doubt might be raised as here. A third interpretation, dating from Serv. and adopted by Burm., and more recently by Schirach, supposes the ‘MASK’ to be the Phrygian cap or mitre which Ascanius may have worn, as it is specially used of the cap worn by the “MASK” and “MASK” at Rome (see 8. 664, and Dict. A. ‘MASK’), which Serv. says Ascanius himself was the first to introduce at Alba: but the whole description seems to show that at this time at least his head was bare. The parallel instance in Roman legend, which doubtless was in Virg.'s mind, is the blazing of the hair of Servius Tullius when a boy, for which see Livy 1. 39. The appearance, wherever it was seen, was supposed to be an omen of future greatness, perhaps of royal dignity, so that here it points out Ascanius as a future king, and shows that the house of Aeneas is destined to survive. Virg. also had in view MASK “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”. — ‘MASK MASK’ seems to be a variety for “MASK MASK MASK” a form of expression of which Persius is particularly fond. “MASK MASK MASK” MASK , which Wund. and Jahn comp., is not parallel, as ‘MASK’ there is the passive supine. ‘MASK’ was adopted by Burm. from a few MSS.; but Virg. is not now thinking of a trail of light. ‘MASK’ is the reading of the great majority of MSS., and is doubtless right, though ‘MASK MASK’ the reading before Heyne, has some plausibility. It has been questioned whether ‘MASK’ belongs to ‘MASK’ or to ‘MASK MASK’ The imitation in Sil. l. c., where “MASK MASK” occurs, may seem to point to the former, and so perhaps MASK in Apoll. l. c.: but the concurrence of the two epithets ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ is a decided objection to it.

Heyne is right in following the obvious order of the words, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” &c. ‘MASK MASK’ (which Henry illustrates from Livy 3. 50, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”) applies really to all three cases, ‘MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ and ‘MASK’ the meaning being that she was separated finally from Aeneas, whatever was the cause: grammatically it belongs only to ‘MASK’ Perhaps there may be something rhetorical in the confusion.

Biog. Dardanus, Iasion): but those which assert MASK connexion between Dardanus and Iasion or Iasius make them brothers. This also might be reconciled with the text, which would then mean that the brothers sprung from Italy, and that Iasius, one of them, was the father of the Trojans. Here again however we should be at issue with the legends, and with Virg.'s language elsewhere, which speak of Dardanus as the author of the race, Iasius having settled, not in Phrygia, but in Samothrace. If then we wish to make Virgil consistent with himself, and with the line of tradition which he seems to have followed, we must suppose him to use ‘MASK’ rather vaguely, and to intend ‘MASK MASK’ to refer to Dardanus.

On the whole the punctuation which gives the best sense seems to be that suggested by Vulpius on Tibull. 4. 1. 70 (after a hint of Serv.) and followed by Heyne and Henry, though there is still room for some difference of opinion on details of interpretation. Taking ‘MASK’ in the sense of “MASK” and regarding ‘MASK MASK’ as in opposition to ‘MASK MASK’ or, better perhaps, as a kind of cognate accusative expressing the effect of ‘MASK MASK’ (see on MASK ), I would translate ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The construction ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is fixed by the parallel 9. 143, where the words recur (as also in Ov. M. 7. 426), and by the similar expression “MASK MASK MASK” 10. 511, so that it will be a descriptive ablative. ‘MASK MASK’ may refer to the two passages, the one nearer to Scylla, the other to Charybdis, both of which were taken by Ulysses—or it may be only a poetical way of describing the one passage as dangerous on both sides. The use of ‘MASK’ for ‘MASK’ is supported by Donatus and Serv., and has vouchers in inscriptions and fragments of lost writings (see Forc.), while it is perhaps to be retained in such passages as MASK . For the position of ‘MASK’ comp. MASK . ‘MASK MASK’ occurs again 4. 46: “MASK MASK” we have had above v. 283. ‘MASK’ does not occur elsewhere in Virg.; but as it is a perfectly good Augustan word, that can be no reason for objecting to the genuineness of the lines, supposing it to be otherwise unimpeached. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as in Hor. 1 Od. 34. 3, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” On the whole we may pronounce that the harshness of the lines, though not to be extenuated, is not great enough to justify us in questioning their authorship, in the face of all external authority—backed as it is by Priscian, who quotes them twice, 15. 2, and 18. 79. The chief difficulty perhaps is in ‘MASK MASK’ for which we should have expected ‘MASK MASK’ as ‘MASK’ v. 682 points to ‘MASK’ rather than to ‘MASK MASK’ The meaning may conceivably be that Aeneas' companions were more alarmed than himself, and took the matter into their own hands, as Ulysses (Od. 12. 224) fears his comrades may do. Heins. conj. ‘MASK MASK’ Ribbeck reads ‘MASK MASK MASK’ from fragm. Vat., and transposes vv. 685, 686, reserving explanation for his (unpublished) Prolegomena. The history of such passages as the supposed exordium of Book 1 and the episode of Helen in Book 2 shows that the early grammarians were jealous of interpolations in Virg.'s text, one recension being in fact a check upon another, so that intrinsic considerations require to be strong indeed in order to shake the credit of lines which no early critic is known to have suspected.

There is however nothing unVirgilian in their language. ‘MASK’ does not stand simply for “MASK MASK” but has its usual sense, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ are undoubtedly MASK MASK in Virg., but they occur in other Augustan writers, and there is nothing in the last of them, as Forb. thinks, foreign to the Epic style: nor is it strange that Aeneas should call Ulysses ‘MASK MASK’ speaking of him in connexion with the partner of his wanderings, and for the moment sympathizing with him as a fellow-sufferer with himself. It may be true that the places mentioned here find no place in Hom.'s account of Ulysses' voyage: but Virg. evidently intends to accommodate Ulysses' journey, as he has done Aeneas', to his own views of geography, as we have just seen in the case of his territory of the Cyclops, which, though not the same as Hom.'s, is still represented as that which Ulysses visited. The intimation that Achemenides informed Aeneas of the names of the places, or (as the words may well mean) acted as his guide, was not necessary indeed, but cannot be called out of place. The construction of the words is not quite clear, as ‘MASK’ may be connected either with ‘MASK MASK’ or with ‘MASK MASK’ or again with both: but the last seems the most probable view. ‘MASK MASK’ then may be compared with “MASK MASK” Ov.

In lengthening the final syllable of ‘MASK’ Virg. has followed the Greek (see Lachm. on MASK ).

A poet with his mind full of the literary and historical interest of his subject is perhaps not unlikely to allow the expression of that feeling to escape him even at the most inappropriate time. We may remember how gladly he avails himself of the prophetic power of Anchises in Book 6 to contrast the small beginnings of Italy with its subsequent greatness (6. 766), and how readily in the later books of the Aeneid he introduces a reference to his own time (12. 134).",,704,0,,,

Possibly they may also be invoked as gods of the new colony, to further the political union between the Carthaginians and the Trojans.

B. ‘MASK’), and Dionysus like Demeter was called MASK (Orph. H. 41. 1). Heyne goes farther, and attempts to show that these three divinities, like Juno, had a special relation to Carthage. Serv. accumulates a number of heterogeneous reasons for their introduction here, which are not worth quoting: he has preserved however two lines of Calvus, which illustrate the mention of Ceres: “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” There is a tantalizing passage in Macrob.

33979078,aeneid_book4,Conington,"Wagn. seems more successful in his attempt to fix a ceremonial sense in ‘MASK’ than in the case of ‘MASK’ (see on MASK ), with which he couples it. The account of this peculiar meaning would appear to be that stated recurrence is a notion so inseparably connected with any thing ritual, that recurring celebration comes to be talked of when nothing more than mere celebration is meant. It is nevertheless true that in many of the passages where it is used of observances there is a more distinct propriety in the notion of renewal, as in v. 145 note, 5. 94, where it is explained by “MASK MASK” 7. 146., 8. 283, where a second feast is spoken of. Thus Stat. Theb. 2. 88, borrowing the words “MASK MASK” from Virg., applies them to a feast which had been interrupted by a brawl. So in Livy 25. 16, when the sacrifice has been disturbed by a portent, it is said “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” It would be possible to give it some such reference here, Dido being said as it were to revive the flagging solemnities of the day as it wore on by ordering new sacrifices; but this would be too artificial. It is however countenanced by Donatus, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Serv. says, much less plausibly, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ladewig supposes Dido to order one sacrifice after another, a reference to which he sees in ‘MASK MASK MASK’ in the hope of obtaining a favourable manifestation, and then, when all fail, to throw the blame on the prophet or priests, v. 65; an exceedingly ingenious view, but one which an attentive consideration of the context will, I think, scarcely warrant.

But surely a question may be raised whether the latter did not include the former. ‘MASK’ of palpitation; see Forc. s. v., where instances are given of its use ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’",,64,0,,,
70576602,aeneid_book4,Conington,"has been connected with ‘MASK MASK’ as in 8. 627, in the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’—a view which might be plausibly supported from v. 464 below. But the ordinary interpretation, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is clearly right, confirmed as it is by Appuleius, Met. 10. p. 682, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” where the reference is to the powerlessness of physic in the case of love, and by Sil. 8. 100, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” also an imitation of this passage (both quoted by Forb.). There is however some room for doubt as to the sentiment intended; Heyne thinks the prophets are censured as ignorant of the terrible future of Dido's love; Gossrau supposes Dido and Anna to be the ‘MASK MASK’ while Ladewig, as we have seen, understands the words as the expression of Dido's impatient despair. Probably Henry is right (after Serv. and Donatus) in supposing the meaning to be that “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” He goes on to say, “‘ Est mollis flamma medullas Interea : ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The hint of the words he seems right in tracing to a curious passage in MASK , where an oracular raven is heard ridiculing a prophet for his ignorance of the ways of a woman in love.

The other circumstances of the simile correspond, as Heyne observes, to those in the simile of Dido to Diana 1. 498 foll. Apollo is supposed to fix his winter quarters in his temple at Patara in Lycia , and thence to go to Delos. Nothing is said about his dividing the year between the two, so that we need not speculate with Henry whether Delos is more than a halting-place on the way to Delphi. The journeyings of Apollo formed the subject of a paean by Alcaeus, the substance of which is preserved by Himerius, Orations 14. 10, and is extracted by Bergk, Poetae Lyrici Graeci , pp. 569, 570 (1st edition). From this it appears that when Apollo was born, Zeus gave him a mitre, a lyre, and a car driven by swans, and sent him to Delphi; but he chose first to go to the Hyperboreans, spending a year with them, and thence going to Delphi, where nature as well as men greeted him with demonstrations of welcome. A passage from Procopius cited by Turnebus, Adversaria 24. 26, speaks of the MASK MASK (an expression supported also by Himerius l. c.) as a festival at Delphi. Serv. says definitely that Apollo was supposed to give oracles for the six winter months at Patara, for the six summer ones at Delos: a practical realization of the belief in Apollo's migratory habits which is supported by Hdt. 1. 182, as Heyne observes in his Excursus.

Taking ‘MASK’ as a sign, and so regarding ‘MASK MASK’ as that in which the sign consisted, we may account sufficiently well for the operation of Juno, who is the mistress of the atmosphere; but the office of Tellus is still undetermined. The generality of commentators, regarding the appearances as inauspicious, suppose the sign given by Earth to be the shock of an earthquake. This was probably the interpretation of Milton, who doubtless intended to imitate the passage in his description of the effects following the first act of sin (Par. Lost, 9. 782 foll., 1000 foll.).

The mighty power of Fame or Rumour is a conception which will bear dwelling on; the thought is appropriate here, as one of the main causes which lead to Dido's death is the sense of the disgrace to which she has brought herself before the world: and Virgil's treatment of MASK is quite in the taste of classical poetry. Such mythological personifications are common enough in Ovid, and MASK is hard to see why Virg. should be altogether debarred the use of them, though doubtless they are to be more sparingly employed in a poem like the Aeneid than in a poem like the Metamorphoses. The hint, as usual, is from Homer, who personifies MASK Il. 2. 93, Od. 24. 412, which last line Virg. has almost copied in the present v. 173; the elaboration of detail too partly comes from the Homeric, MASK , Il. 4. 442, 443.

I do not know whether it is an objection to this view that when in 1. 225 Jupiter looks down upon Libya, he is expressly said to be standing not at the west gate of Olympus but at the vertex: but in any case it seems rash to suppose that the ancient poets generally were agreed in their notions of Olympian topography.",,246,0,,,

If indeed we might read with the Delphin editor ‘MASK MASK’ we should obtain a clear and intelligible sense—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ I do not know why Wagn. calls this “MASK MASK” the objection which occurs at first sight, that Dido would thus speak too plainly of a resolution which she afterwards takes such pains to conceal from her sister, is, as we shall see, not convincing: the expression would, I think, strike any one as sufficiently natural and unforced, if the reading were undoubted; and the strongest improbability in the case is the general one founded on the almost invariable trustworthiness of one or other of Virg.'s MSS. Henry's interpretation adopts not only ‘MASK’ but ‘MASK MASK’ understanding Dido to say that if Aeneas grants her the favour of a little delay, she, though brought lower than the grave (‘MASK MASK’ = in aggravated death, in a state worse than death), will abate her passion. The intransitive sense of ‘MASK’ is possible enough: but the interpretation of ‘MASK MASK’ is absolutely impossible, and not justified by a less forced expression in a more forced writer, Statius, who in Theb. 11. 582 speaks of Oedipus' blindness as “MASK MASK MASK” On the whole, the chief value of ‘MASK’ seems to be that it has given occasion for a very ingenious conjecture of Schrader, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ which would suit ‘MASK MASK’ the sense produced being ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Accepting the ordinary reading as having the authority of Serv., we shall not find much difficulty in giving ‘MASK’ the sense of “MASK MASK” though it does not seem to have been generally used as its conventional equivalent (comp. Hor. A. P. 349, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”), while ‘MASK’ will naturally mean ‘MASK MASK’ as in Livy 2. 23, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ may be either the abl. instr. with ‘MASK MASK’ or used as in v. 502 below, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Here again the difficulty is in the general sense. Roughly considered, the meaning seems to be that Dido's death will bring to Anna a return for her kindness; but it is not easy to see what the return can be, and so to determine whether the death is to be the cause of its being made or merely the occasion. Wagn.'s notion that Dido hints that she will bequeath her kingdom to Anna is unworthy of the occasion, and not supported by any thing else in this book, while it has not even the justification of consistency with the legend, which makes Anna after her sister's death migrate into Italy. Perhaps we may say, borrowing a hint from Serv., that Dido's language is intentionally obscure, her meaning being that her return for Anna's kindness will be that she will kill herself, and so rid her sister of the burden. Anna would take the words as a mere expression of desperation, their very obscurity preventing her from attaching too much meaning to them. So her language in v. 419 is worded in a manner which might have led any one already on the watch to infer the worst, while an unsuspecting person like Anna would take it in a good sense, knowing moreover, as Virg. reminds us v. 502, that Dido had once before endured successfully what seemed even a worse sorrow. Generally we may say that while Dido's purpose is still undecided, she does not shrink from speaking of death, though her words are little more than those of vague desperation. It is only when she has seen death to be her only course that she is anxious that no one should suspect what she is meditating. Sophocles has represented just the same change of feeling in Ajax, who talks wildly of death on his first recovery from his frenzy, but afterwards, when he is quite resolved to die, contrives an elaborate blind for Tecmessa and the Chorus. Thus that Dido should speak of death here is no more than we should expect, though the precise import of her words may be left undetermined. Ribbeck, adopting ‘MASK MASK’ reads ‘MASK MASK MASK’ apparently from his own conjecture. The old editors placed the comma after ‘MASK MASK’ not after ‘MASK MASK’ With the parenthetical ‘MASK MASK’ comp. “MASK MASK” v. 478, which may be meant as a contrast to it. ‘MASK’ of a favour. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” Ter.

The sense which it would yield has found favour with several critics, Markland conjecturing ‘MASK’ (used as in Greek for a title of the Furies), a suggestion of great plausibility, supported by Val. Fl. 7. 147, which will be quoted below, accepted by Wakef., and approved by Heyne, while Lersch and Henry (the latter of whom now withdraws the interpretation) wish to give ‘MASK’ the sense of MASK MASK . Hildebrand, followed by Ladewig, emends ‘MASK MASK’ which I suppose is meant to be constructed with ‘MASK MASK’ The object of all these expedients is to avoid the reference to the stage, it being supposed that an ancient poet would more naturally think of the real Pentheus and MASK as parallel to Dido, herself a personage of similar antiquity, than of their theatrical representatives. But it is quite in keeping with Virg.'s literary tastes that he should interest himself more in the dramatic persons that he had seen or read of than in their supposed prototypes. Such a feeling, it is true, is not the simple feeling of an old poet: to conceive of any thing of the kind in Homer would involve a grotesque impossibility. But the comparison of one mythical person to another is equally foreign to Homer. His similes are limited in their range: heroes and their actions are paralleled to the more ordinary occupations of life, to inferior creatures or natural phenomena. He does not tell us that Achilles resented the abduction of Briseis as Meleager did the slight offered to Atalanta. Virg. must be judged by his own standard; and there is nothing inconsistent with that standard in supposing that the Pentheus of his thoughts was the Pentheus of Euripides, the MASK of Aeschylus. He doubtless felt that it was to the stage that he owed the glorious vision of their madness, and he was glad to make the acknowledgment. It is this feeling which dictates the presents, ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK’ The frenzy of the Theban and the Argive is not a thing of the past, embalmed in legend; it is constantly repeating itself; it is present as often as the Bacchae or the Eumenides are acted, read, or remembered. As before, we cannot determine whether Virg. had any single play exclusively in his mind. Serv. says that Pacuvius (in his Dolorestes or Dulorestes?) represented MASK as entering Apollo's temple at the instance of Pylades and being attacked by the Furies when he tried to leave it. In Aesch. Eum. the ghost of Clytaemnestra appears, but does not haunt MASK, contenting herself with stirring up the Erinnyes. ‘MASK MASK’ I understand to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ the sense of ‘MASK’ being fixed by the context, and by the parallels 3. 331., 12. 668, Cic. Rosc. Am. 24, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” That Ausonius uses the words ‘MASK MASK’ in the sense of ‘MASK MASK MASK’ may prove that he had Virg.'s words in his mind, but need only prove further that he did not consider himself bound by Virg.'s meaning, when another suited him better and suited the genius of the language as well. In other words, the objection to the interpretation which Serv. gives as an alternative to that adopted above, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” is not that it is doubtful Latin, but that it would yield a very frigid sense. I will now transcribe the passage to which I referred from Valerius Flaccus , as the detail into which the description is carried makes it more than a mere repetition of Virg.

A. P. 375, to have been considered a great delicacy among the Romans, forming, at least in early times, part of the second course at a banquet. That ‘MASK’ means sprinkling on the food, not sprinkling on the ground as a separate and substantive article of food, he argues from a passage where Petronius says, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ too favours this. ‘MASK’ it must be admitted, is a very unfortunate epithet, as the object of the food cannot have been to lull the ever-wakeful dragon; it is not simply inappropriate or idle, like other epithets which Henry or others quote, but actually mal à propos. As a physical description it is accurate enough, the “MASK MASK“somniferum”MASK MASK” being specified by Pliny as the particular kind of poppy whose seeds were so employed. All attempts to modify or evade this obvious sense must be pronounced failures: e. g. Serv.'s new punctuation, adopted by Gossrau, which connects ‘MASK’ &c. with what follows, Turnebus' fancy that the dragon required to be put to sleep occasionally that he might not break down from overwatching, Jahn's supposition that honey and poppies were strewn about to keep intruders away, and Waddel's suggestion that the priestess may have dealt with soporifics as Macbeth wished to deal with physic, throwing them to the dogs to keep them out of the dragon's way. But perhaps it may still be open to some unusually audacious critic to hint that Virg., by a strange confusion, such as might possibly happen to a great writer who never lived to revise his poem, thought of the dragon for the moment as a creature which the priestess was to subdue or elude, and so made her exercise her charming power in sending it to sleep.

It is still a question whether ‘MASK MASK’ is said by Dido of herself or of Aeneas. The latter is supported by Dido's language v. 496 above, and by Tibull. 3. 6. 42, quoted by Wagn., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” of Theseus' desertion of Ariadne. But in this case it is difficult to explain the next line, the full construction of which must be ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ Dido had no reason to think Aeneas treacherous when she offered him a share in the crown: he had treated no one else with the same perfidy. Wagn. attempts to get over this by understanding ‘MASK MASK’ “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but the question recurs, had be given ground for suspicion? The very next words seem to say that all his previous actions had been in his favour, and that his present faithlessness makes her disbelieve that they ever took place. Her regret for not having slain him, vv. 600 foll., refers not to the time of her welcoming him, but to that of her becoming first aware of his treachery, as ‘MASK’ v. 604 shows.

It may seem indeed that Ovid himself sanctions this interpretation, as his preceding line is “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which may be an imitation of v. 595. Heyne, who also refers ‘MASK MASK’ to Dido, thinks she is struck with horror at her wish to avenge herself on her lover, and then wishes that her moral sense had been as keen earlier: but this is far less likely, and scarcely consistent with the access of fury v. 600, or indeed with the tone of the whole speech, which, tempestuous as it is, gives no sign of relenting towards Aeneas.

60509380,aeneid_book4,Conington,"Virg. has doubtless framed Dido's imprecations so that, while intended by her to be all that is dreadful, they should be susceptible of a much more endurable fulfilment. The imprecation of Polyphemus in Homer is something of the same kind: there however the relief is found in the fact that the curse only extends to Ulysses' arrival MASK home, and so is not incompatible with his subsequent triumph over his enemies. Dido is more unrelenting: she prays that he may have to fight, to leave his settlement and his son, implore foreign aid, submit to a disgraceful peace, die prematurely, and be deprived of burial. Aeneas does meet with opposition (Book 7): he has to leave Ascanius in the camp and entreat aid from Evander (Books 8 and 9): the final peace involves concessions to the Latins and the extinction of the Trojan name (Book 12): while his death, according to one legend, which Virg. probably followed (see 1. 265), happened when he had reigned only three years, and his body, if not left ‘MASK MASK MASK’ did not meet with burial, being swallowed up in the Numicius, or, according to another account, not being found after a battle. Yet Aeneas' career after reaching Italy would have been felt to be a prosperous one, just as the Romans of Virg.'s day would feel that the eternal feud between Troy and Carthage, and the actual appearance of the threatened avenger, were not painful but glorious recollections.

Yet this seems inconsistent with the words of v. 507, which can hardly be understood of a thing which did not belong to Aeneas at the time of his departure. The alternative seems to be to suppose the sword to have been Dido's present to Aeneas, already mentioned v. 261 foll., which he may be assumed to have left behind him MASK his haste. ‘MASK’ then would have to mean ‘MASK’ as Aeneas was not likely to have begged for it.

The point was that none but good words should be uttered before a sacrifice, and the spectators in consequence either repeated what the priest said or did not speak at all.

If by ‘MASK MASK’ is meant to leave the contest undecided, which is the general opinion (Heyne, who adopts it, referring ‘MASK’ to Helymus as a person), there can be little doubt that ‘MASK’ should be read, as it could not be said that in a context like this the two cases could be represented except as alternatives. And this interpretation seems to be exactly confirmed by Il. 23. 382, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK , which Virg. probably had in his mind, as ‘MASK MASK’ seems to be modelled on Hom.'s description in the three lines immediately preceding. But there is another passage which also Virg. had before him, Il. 23. 526, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK MASK , MASK MASK MASK , and this would suggest another interpretation of Virg.'s words, proposed long ago by Turnebus 14. 4, apparently adopted by Cerda, and now revived by Henry, who does not seem aware that he has been anticipated, giving ‘MASK’ the special sense of leaving behind in a race, like the passive MASK (comp. Hor. A. P. 417, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” and other places), so that the meaning will be ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ i. e. would make him doubtful no longer, but clearly defeated. This view I now accept, as satisfactory in itself and recommended by the unanimous concurrence of the MSS. in ‘MASK MASK’ though, had the preponderance been reversed, I should see no sufficient reason for leaving the ordinary interpretation. Against the new one it may perhaps be urged that it does not bring Virg. into absolute conformity with Hom., who does not mean that Menelaus and Antilochus were MASK as it was, but that Menelaus in a longer course would not only have become MASK but superior, while Virg. on the other hand, as thus interpreted, represents Helymus as already no more than ‘MASK MASK’ and also that the case of Helymus and Diores is more like that of Eumelus and Diomed, who were nearly even from the first, than that of Menelaus and Antilochus, whose places were reversed during the race by an act of fraud, so that Menelaus, in passing his rival, would only have been asserting the intrinsic superiority which he had all along.

Aeneas, immediately on its appearance, as we shall see (v. 530), interprets it favourably, but what happened subsequently showed that he was mistaken. What then was the event portended? The old interpretation was, the burning of the ships: but this disaster, soon over and soon repaired, would hardly suit v. 524, which points apparently to something more terrible and more distant. Wagn. supposes it to be the impending war in Italy; but Acestes had nothing to do with this either as actor or as sufferer. It seems more probable that Heyne is right in referring it to the wars between Rome and Sicily. But there is no need to fix it at all, as long as we regard it as identified with some adequate occurrence in the subsequent history of Sicily. Wagn. censures the awkwardness of alluding to something extraneous to the poem and not specified; but Gossrau remarks that Virg. is probably not inventing this story of the portent and its supposed accomplishment, but repeating what he found in a legend.

The natural way of understanding would seem to be that all have their hair bound (comp. 4. 148, “MASK MASK MASK”） with a wreath of stripped leaves (‘MASK MASK’ for ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ comp. v. 774, MASK note). But how is this to be reconciled with their wearing helmets (v. 673)? Wreaths were sometimes put over the helmet, as appears from 7. 751, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” which would agree with ‘MASK’ here, that being probably a sign that oliveleaves are meant (v. 774 &c.). But MASK that case the hair must be confined by the helmet, not by the wreath. Cerda proves from MASK , Fast. 3. 2 that ‘MASK’ would naturally be said of the pressure of a helmet (comp. also 9. 612, “MASK MASK MASK”), as ‘MASK’ of its removal; but this will not help us here, unless we are to suppose that Virg. is thinking of wreath and helmet both, while only mentioning the former. Peerlkamp apparently considers the wreath to be under the helmet, to which Forb. answers, that MASK that case the helmet would not fit. But it seems possible that there might be a wreath worn just below the helmet, so as not to interfere with it— a variety of the custom mentioned 7. 751. And MASK this interpretation I incline to acquiesce, till a better shall have been proposed. Henry, following Gesner MASK his Thesaurus, thinks the meaning is that the hair of the boys was cut round, as was that of the Roman boys (a custom expressed by ‘MASK MASK’ according to Virg.'s usual habit of ascribing Roman usages to the Trojans). He compares the words used by St. Jerome MASK translating and commenting on Ezekiel 44. 20, where the poll of the Jewish priests is spoken of (a mode of wearing the hair which he believes to have been as nearly as possible the same as that MASK use among the Roman boys), “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” the use of ‘MASK’ for pruning or lopping leaves ( MASK &c.), and that of ‘MASK’ MASK modern Italian for pollarding a tree.

Heyne thought that ‘MASK MASK MASK’ perhaps meant each splits into four companies of three horsemen each, which would complicate the picture needlessly: Wagn. and Forb. suppose no more to be meant than that the three ‘MASK MASK’ having been together while they passed in procession, now separate: but, as Henry remarks, the previous context, so far from leading us to suppose that they ever formed into one, distinctly suggests the contrary. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ according to Virg.'s wont, is explained by the following clause. There is something antithetical in the combination of the two words, ‘MASK’ alone suggesting the notion of irregular dispersion (9. 164., 12. 590), as if it had been said “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” ‘MASK’ being distributed into three, that being as it were the basis of their ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK MASK MASK’ they separate, keeping their original distinction into three, so that there are not simply two companies, right and left, but three pairs of companies.

Virg.'s words, it seems to me, become purposely rather indefinite at this point, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ merely expressing that these retreats and charges keep going on in one form or another. ‘MASK MASK’ (so Wagn. from Med. and Rom., for ‘MASK MASK’ Pal. and Gud.) seems to imply that they still keep their ground, right and left respectively, as they took it in v. 580, though they are continually advancing and retreating over the ground. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ opposed in point of ground, is of course the same thing as ‘MASK MASK MASK’ ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘alternisque’MASK MASK MASK MASK’ is I think rightly referred by the generality of the commentators to complicated circular evolutions as it were entangling each other. The ‘MASK’ are not really confused, but their movements are so ingeniously intricate that they appear confused: the effect produced is that of circles involved in or cutting each other. “MASK MASK MASK MASK” occurs 8. 448 of the shield of Aeneas, where, though the entanglement of the circles is not the same as that here supposed, the picture is still less like what Henry imagines, circles preventing each other from being circles. Besides, Virg. has himself shown that he intends not single but highly complicated evolutions by the comparison to the labyrinth which immediately follows—a comparison which would be unmeaning if the movements of the ‘MASK’ had been such as the eye could easily trace. Whether these circular evolutions are the same as what is described generally in v. 583, or something different, it is not easy to say. There will be no reference in any case to the military sense of ‘MASK’ ( = ‘MASK’） for a mass of men. ‘MASK’ implies that the complication was reciprocal. ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ seems to be general—‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The expression is from MASK , 324, “MASK MASK MASK MASK” which is actually copied below v. 674. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ above v. 440.",,583-585,0,,,

On the other hand, an objection might perhaps be raised with justice to Aeneas' separating himself from the rest, as he does according to the common interpretation, and calling for his own destruction as the one thing wanted to crown the national misery.

The sense would seem to require that we should supply some antecedent for ‘MASK’ from the sentence itself, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ &c., or regard ‘MASK’ as acc. pl. of ‘MASK MASK’ But I believe Virg. meant ‘MASK’ to be connected with ‘MASK MASK’ speaking of the responses as portended by the wrath of heaven or demanded by the order of fate, to show how completely the responses represented and were identified with the events. The events or responses are said to be portended by the wrath of the gods, whereas we should rather expect to hear that the wrath of the gods was itself portended by supernatural appearances: but though ‘MASK’ seems generally to bear the latter meaning, the substantive ‘MASK’ is quite in accordance with the former. ‘MASK MASK’ occurs elsewhere, as in MASK , of a god giving forth a response to those who consulted him, but there can be no reason why it should not be used also of suggesting a response to another which he is to give forth.

Heyne, who placed a semicolon after ‘MASK MASK’ seems to have regarded it as i. q. ‘MASK MASK’ to which Wagn. objects that the request which follows, so far from being an afterthought, is the main object of Venus' speech. This objection is not quite conclusive, as there might even be a dramatic propriety in the request so introduced. Venus has been carried on by her impetuosity into an enumeration of Juno's crimes, and now bethinks herself of what she wants to have done, at the same time that she may purposely adopt a phrase which rather disguises her anxiety about the main point. Such a defence however can hardly be urged against other views equally reconcilable with the language, and not requiring to be reconciled with the context. Henry understands it to mean ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which would agree with the common interpretation of the words in v. 691, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” But Neptune's help was really worth far more to them than this, though it may again be replied that it suits Venus' purpose to extenuate the boon. Two other interpretations are mentioned by Wagn., “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” or “MASK MASK” and “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The former brings the passage into conformity with what appears on the whole the best view of v. 691, at the same time that it supplies a subject for ‘MASK MASK’ which would otherwise perhaps be too obscure with ‘MASK’ following. Besides, the latter is open to one or two objections of its own: it is not suggested by the immediate context, which speaks of the burning of the ships, the Aeolian storm having been dismissed in v. 792: perhaps also it makes Venus assume too readily that their journey is near its end, as if distance and tempests had been the only causes of its prolongation.

The story is easily explained if we suppose with Conrads (see Introduction to this Book) that the present book is an afterthought, Virg. having originally intended to bring Aeneas direct from Carthage to Italy. In that case vv. 1, 2 of Book 6 really belong to the later draught, and in that sense are separable from the lines which they at present precede. As the poem now stands, no reader of taste will, I think, wish to disturb the arrangement of the ordinary editions, supplying as it does an affecting close to the book, which would be spoiled by carrying our thoughts on to Aeneas' safe arrival. The apparent abruptness of the opening of the next book, ‘MASK MASK MASK’ is doubtless due to an imitation of the opening of Il. 7, Od. 13.

This however does not prove that cypresses were planted before funeral piles, while we know on other authority that they were used in making or dressing the piles. Serv. tells us from Varro that piles were surrounded with cypresses that the smell of the burning wood might overpower that of the burning body, and Stat. 9. 460., 5. 54, in passages apparently imitated from the present, makes the cypress used in the composition of the pile.

Some of these monsters had been actually killed, so that it was natural that they should appear spectrally in Hades; others, like the Harpies, were products of the infernal world (comp. 3. 214), and though when appearing on earth they may have had bodies, they may be supposed to be divested of them in the shades, where spirit acts upon spirit.

Generally we may say that Virg. found the notion of a single river of death most convenient for poetical purposes, but that he wished as usual to introduce the various points of the legends he followed, and so he employed the names Acheron, Cocytus, and Styx, whenever the river was to be spoken of, with a dim conception of Acheron as emptying itself into Cocytus, and perhaps of Styx as the most inward of the three, and a clear one of Phlegethon as specially surrounding Tartarus. Plato gives a much more definite description in his Phaedo, pp. 112, 113, speaking of four rivers, Ocean, Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, and Styx, the last of which disappears under the earth and reappears as Cocytus, an attempt apparently to realize the picture in Hom.: and later Roman poets, as Heyne observes, Exc. 9, have introduced varieties of their own.",,295,0,,,

If we take ‘MASK MASK’ in its ordinary sense, it may be modelled on the various uses of MASK in Hom. ‘MASK’ of plunging in doom vv. 512, 615. ‘MASK’ is specially used of untimely death, as in Cic.

74481783,aeneid_book6,Conington,"The meaning seems clear, that a separate place is assigned to those who have met their death by unjust condemnation. It has been asked why they should be made to suffer: but there is no suffering in this part of the shades; there is merely the absence of the enjoyment of life, the Homeric condition of the dead which Achilles declares to be worse than the lowest function on earth. That they should endure this is not unjust: the iniquity which dismissed them from life does not make their lives good or bad; that is decided by Minos, as we shall see immediately. We should expect however that they would not occupy this place permanently, but that on the rehearing of their case some would be despatched to Tartarus, others to Elysium. But Virg. does not say this, and if we compare the case of these persons with those of the infants and the suicides, we may doubt whether he intended it. Infants remain in their limbo apparently because they have had no opportunity of showing whether they were worthy of Elysium or of Tartarus; those who have cut short their own lives are not to be credited with the good or evil of their lives, but are consigned at once and for ever to a twilight condition like that imagined by Hom.: and so perhaps the victims of unjust sentences may be dealt with as those who having accidentally come into the state of death are exempted alike from reward and punishment. But we must not probe Virg.'s meaning too deeply: he has deserted the simplicity of Hom. for something far more complicated, and it is not surprising that in borrowing details from other sources he should have been led occasionally to combine inconsistencies. Warburton thought the reference here was to a story in Plato's Gorgias, pp. 523 foll., where the establishment of infernal judges is said to have been owing to the inequality of the sentences originally passed by living judges who had to decide the condition after death of those who were still in the body. Virg. may have thought of this: but his words are hardly reconcilable with it, as Warburton admits by his proposal to alter ‘MASK’ into ‘MASK MASK’ Virg. coincides with Plato in putting the place of judgment before the spot where the roads to Tartarus and Elysium diverge (vv. 540 foll.), and also in particularizing Minos, who according to Plato is a supreme judge of appeal, Asiatics being judged in the first instance by Rhadamanthus, Europeans by Aeacus. Virg. may also have thought of another passage in Plato, of which Cerda reminds us—that in the Apology, p. 41 B, where Socrates dwells on the pleasure of meeting in the shades those who, like himself, have died in consequence of an unjust sentence, MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK , such as Palamedes and the greater Ajax, though it is clear that if Plato had been asked where he intended to place these, he would have replied, in Elysium. There still remains a difficulty about the construction, as ‘MASK’ may be connected either with ‘MASK’ or with ‘MASK MASK’ Perhaps in the absence of any instance of ‘MASK MASK’=“MASK MASK” (comp. “MASK MASK MASK” “MASK MASK”), it will be safer to adopt the former, ‘MASK’ with the gen. of the punishment being sufficiently common (see Forc. s. v.).",,430,0,,,
30044439,aeneid_book6,Conington,"seems to be used generally of the lower world, so that this and the two following lines will be virtually parenthetical. At the same time it would be too much to suppose that Virg. meant to commit himself to stating that the jurisdiction of Minos extended to all those who came down into the shades; we should rather infer, as was hinted in the last note, that some at least of those who died prematurely were left without any judgment at all, and consigned neither to Tartarus nor to Elysium. What the effect of this new judgment is on those on whom it is undoubtedly meant to operate, the falsely condemned, he has not told us, and perhaps he did not clearly realize himself. Meantime in this line, as in those that follow, he has introduced the phraseology of the Roman law, ‘MASK MASK’ apparently referring to the “MASK MASK MASK” the choice by lot of “MASK” for a particular case out of the whole judicial body. (The notion of Serv. and some early critics that the reference is to the drawing of lots to decide the order in which the causes should come on is far less likely.) In any case Minos is represented as ‘MASK MASK’ the name given to the presiding magistrate on a Roman criminal trial, who was assisted by the ‘MASK’ just mentioned. To say any thing definite about those who in the world below would answer to these ‘MASK’ would have been embarrassing to Virg., as, if Rhadamanthus and Aeacus were meant, they would hold their places without “MASK MASK” while it would not be easy to conceive of a judicial body among the shades themselves: so the poet as usual leaves the matter in obscurity. The pseudoAsconius however, commenting on Cic. Verr. Act. 1. 10, refers to this passage in the following words: “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ quaesitorem ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ urnam ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ consiliumque vocat : ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ vitasque et crimina discit . ’” But though ‘MASK’ is the technical term for the ‘MASK’ in relation to the presiding magistrate, and the word is found in Pal. and Gud. a m. p., the context is against it, as we should expect the ‘MASK’ to be the same as those whose ‘MASK MASK MASK’ are the subject of cognizance, though the position of ‘MASK’ does not necessarily prove this (see on G. 2. 119). Mr. Long suggests that the ‘MASK’ may consist of those who have been tried and pronounced innocent. On the whole it seems better to retain ‘MASK’ and refer it to the assemblage of those who are to be tried. Sen. H. F. 735 has “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” an evident imitation of Virg., but not showing what he understood by “MASK MASK” though he goes on to mention Minos, Rhadamanthus , and Aeacus as judges in separate courts. ‘MASK MASK’ assigned to their occupants: the word however seems to have been chosen as associated with ‘MASK’ in the expression “MASK MASK MASK” which occurs 1. 139.",,431,0,,,

To this explanation we are helped by the words of Hom. quoted on v. 577. We should have expected some mention of the earth, but Virg., writing with Hom. and Lucr. in his mind, was perhaps less likely to cultivate perfect clearness of expression, and he doubtless intended ‘MASK’ to be pressed, the earth being the only place from which a person could look up to heaven. This seems more likely than the view apparently held by Donatus and glanced at by Heyne, which would make the meaning to be that the depth of Tartarus below the infernal plains is as great as the height of heaven viewed, if it could be viewed, from the infernal plains; though there would be nothing harsh in thus slurring over ‘MASK MASK’ if we did not suppose Virg. to have the parallel of Hom. in his mind.

Ixion and Pirithous stand for the whole class of hitherto unnamed criminals: the tortures which follow are chosen not as those which the persons specified individually suffered, but as belonging to some of the number. In this again there is a dramatic and poetical propriety, at the same time that the confusion is justified by the fact that the legends on which Virg. had to build were not always accordant in their accounts,—Hom. e. g. representing Tantalus as tormented with perpetual hunger and thirst (Od. 11. 582 foll.), while Pindar (Olymp. 1. 55 foll.) and Lucr. (3. 980) make him the victim of the everthreatening stone mentioned in the next line. Thus ‘MASK’ is regularly constructed after ‘MASK MASK MASK’ as its antecedent. “MASK MASK” v. 123 above. Comp.

On the other hand, the two punishments are not easily combined in thought, the point of the terror of the overhanging rock being that it distracts the victim's mind from any thing else, while the banquet is represented as rendered impossible, not by the alarm of the rock, but by the interference of the Fury. If the view taken on v. 601 is the correct one, there is of course a further reason for supposing more than one punishment to be spoken of. On the whole then I think that two punishments are named, and those only as specimens of an infinite number. The hint of the banquet is evidently given by the Homeric description of Tantalus, but the circumstances are varied with considerable judgment, the board spread with artificial dainties being substituted for the simpler features of lake-water and orchard-trees.

Theseus and Phlegyas are represented as doomed to sit at a similar banquet, the poet having either followed another legend, or availed himself of Virg.'s example to introduce changes of his own. ‘MASK MASK’ are entirely different from the ‘MASK MASK’ or bridal bed, though both receive their name from the genius, the deification of the happier and more impulsive part of man (see on MASK ). ‘MASK MASK’ is a feast-day, and so ‘MASK MASK’ is a banqueting couch, whether the expression is Virg.'s own or borrowed from common language. ‘MASK MASK’ so “MASK MASK MASK” 2. 2.

St. Paul's application of MASK MASK MASK Gal. 3. 13 to crucifixion, the primary reference of the words being different, as is remarked by Ellicott in loco), and argues that ‘MASK’ points the same way. But it signifies little what was the precise image Virg. had before his mind, the real point being that the spirit is hung up in such a way as to secure its purification by air. Serv. refers to the ‘MASK’ in the festival of Bacchus ( MASK note, where the parallel is mentioned by anticipation): but Gossrau remarks that no one but Serv. seems to have connected these with purification, and that other traditional notices of them explain them differently. “MASK MASK” 10. 82. Henry ingeniously makes ‘MASK’ here the nom., supposing the meaning to be that the winds blow through the unsubstantial forms of the spirits: there would however be something awkward in the predicative epithet here, when we have already to connect ‘MASK’ closely with ‘MASK MASK’ and it is possible that the same meaning may be intended by the application of the epithet to the winds, which being thin and unsubstantial, are conceived of as the more penetrating.

Planc. 4.",,742,0,,,
64389407,aeneid_book6,Conington,"These lines are among the hardest in Virg. The first sentence ‘MASK MASK MASK’ has puzzled the commentators perhaps more than it would have done had they sufficiently remembered Virg.'s fondness for artificial phrases. The general meaning evidently is ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ This Virg. has apparently chosen to express by saying ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ the Manes, which appear to have been a sort of twofold genius belonging to each person (see on 4. 610), being regarded as separable from the person himself, and as subjecting him to inflictions: at the same time that Virg. probably intended to avail himself of other possible constructions, the cognate accusative, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK’ and the accusative of definition, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ The suggestion that the Genius is meant is made by Serv., but it seems better not to regard it as exhausting the meaning of the passage, as the Manes or Genius elsewhere appear to stand for the deified individual, and their visitations, as in 4. 610, take effect not on the individual himself but on his enemies. We are also helped by the consideration that elsewhere in Virg. the infernal powers are spoken of loosely as ‘MASK’ (10. 39., 12. 646, MASK , 505), though it would be too much to infer from this with Cerda and others that ‘MASK’ here simply = ‘MASK’ if it were only that the words so interpreted would be open to the objection made in the last sentence, the Furies of a person generally meaning not the Furies that punish a person, but those which, being his embodied curses, punish his enemies (see on 4. 384). It is true that there is a distinct instance where ‘MASK’ appears to be used for spiritual punishment, Stat. Theb. 8. 84, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” but this proves no more than that Stat. there as elsewhere ventured on an experiment in language in imitation, as he thought, of Virg. Professor Munro, Journal of Philology, vol. 2, pp. 145, 146 says, “‘ Quisque suos patimur Manis ’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘we put on, bear the burden, each one of us good or bad, of his own manes or garb of death,’MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK‘ Donator atrae lucis , Alcide , tuum Diti remitte munus , ereptos mihi Restitue manis : inpius frustra invoco Mortem relictam . ’” The difficulty of what follows is greater. The words are easy, but it is not easy to see the appropriateness of the sentence to the context. As they stand, they appear to speak of a second purgation as going on in Elysium, which is in itself not a very likely thing, while the change of person from ‘MASK’ and ‘MASK’ to ‘MASK’ v. 750 has still to be accounted for. Jahn, whose explanation is approved by Forb., supposes that all the shades are sent into Elysium after their purgation, but that while the greater part only pass through on their way to Lethe, a few, of whom Anchises is one, are allowed to remain there and complete a still higher purification, as a prelude to a new and glorious life on earth. This is probably as plausible an explanation as is likely to be suggested of the passage as it stands, but the inconsistencies of it lie on the surface. Elysium, as has been said above, is not a natural place for purgation; it is evidently the everlasting reward of a good life, not a place of temporary sojourn previous to a return to earth: there is nothing in vv. 741, 742, as compared with vv. 745—747, to show that the degree of purification contemplated in the latter is intended to be higher than that in the former: the ‘MASK MASK’ of v. 748 are plainly parallel to the ‘MASK MASK’ of v. 745; and it can hardly be meant that the more highly purified spirits return to earth without a draught of Lethe. A general view of the context seems to require, as Heyne and some of the early editors, and more lately Henry, have seen, that the souls which are purified and sent back to earth should be distinguished from the select few who are purified and established in Elysium, and this the change of person decidedly favours. The words ‘MASK MASK MASK’ then, if not the previous clause, will refer to the latter, the whole of the following lines to the former, who, as being far the larger number, are spoken of as if they were the whole body. But this sense, though required by the context and favoured by the language, does not suit the order of the passage. Heyne and his contemporaries wished to get rid of the difficulty by transposing the two lines before us, which is Ribbeck's remedy; Henry thinks they are no more than an ordinary Virgilian parenthesis. The first suggestion appears to me as much too violent as the second is too lenient. The supposition of a confusion of the order introduced by the transcribers is at all times hazardous (see on MASK —205), and is exposed to unusual suspicion here, as the lines would still look awkward if placed, where alone they could be placed, after v. 747, so that Heyne inclines to treat them as altogether spurious; while on the other hand, if Virg. intended no more than an ordinary parenthesis, it must be admitted that his sentence is exceedingly ill constructed. I think then that every thing points to the supposition, which at one time occurred to Heyne himself, that we have here one of the passages in the Aeneid (the case of the Georgics is different: see on MASK —205) which Virg. left unfinished. His whole conception of a metempsychosis seems, as I have said in the prefatory remarks to this book, to be really inconsistent with the general picture which he gives of the world of spirits, and so he naturally found a difficulty in harmonizing the two in Anchises' narrative. Had the Aeneid been a finished poem, the obstacle would doubtless have been surmounted so far as the mechanical structure of the present passage is concerned, but we should have felt it nevertheless in reading the Sixth Book. A doubt still remains whether ‘MASK’ refers to the whole body of the departed, as ‘MASK’ evidently does, or to the few spoken of in the next clause. In the one case the meaning will be that the whole multitude is sent through Elysium, the greater part to drink the Lethe water and then return to life, the few to remain in Elysium: in the other, that the few are distributed among the spacious plains, a use of ‘MASK’ for which see on 1. 680. On the whole the former view seems to agree best with the language of these two lines, while any objection which may be raised to it from the language of vv. 748 foll., where Lethe seems to be introduced for the first time, is obviated by the consideration mentioned above, that the present passage as left by Virg. is not meant to cohere with the context. ‘MASK MASK MASK’ like “MASK MASK MASK” 1. 538.",,"743,744",0,,,

L. 9. 38),—or born after the father's last will (Gaius Inst. 1. 147, Ulpian Dig. 26. 2, 5, referred to by Freund s. v.: see Dict. A. “MASK MASK” Roman). Here it evidently has its original meaning, as Caesellius Vindex ap. Gell. 2. 16 long ago remarked, though Serv. and in later times even Henry and Sir G. Lewis give it the sense of ‘MASK’ contrary to the plain meaning of the next line. Virg. seems to have intended to translate the Homeric MASK , as the commentators remark. The word appears to be restricted to children, till we come to writers like Apuleius and Tertullian, who use it as convertible with ‘MASK MASK’ In the legendary accounts Silvius seems actually to have been called Silvius Postumus : see Lewis, Credibility, vol. 1, pp. 357 foll.",,763,0,,,

In the latter kingdom Silvius eventually succeeded Ascanius, either in default of heirs, or because the actual heir, named Iulus, was too young. Some made Silvius the son of Ascanius, and so Livy 1. 4, who speaks of him as “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Virg. apparently adopts the tradition generally, without thinking it necessary to specify the circumstances of Silvius' birth in the woods, while he indirectly contradicts the story of MASK's fear of Ascanius, which would have jarred on all readers of the Aeneid, by representing Silvius as born in his father's lifetime. The legends of the sequel of Aeneas' life after his settlement in Latium are not altogether reconcilable with the treatment adopted by Virg. in the Aeneid. Virg. doubtless could have harmonized them with his purpose, had he pleased, as skilfully as he has harmonized discordant materials in the story of the Aeneid itself: but he has chosen instead to regard them from a distance, without distinctly committing himself to any one version of them. Even thus however he has not been able to escape some inconsistencies, as the present passage shows, compared with that in the First Book. There (1. 265 foll.) we are told by implication that Aeneas' death and deification takes place three years after his landing in Latium: here he is spoken of as living to old age, a time which must have been conceived of by Virg. as long subsequent to that in which he captivated Dido: there the name of Ascanius is associated with Alba, here that of Silvius. These statements, it is true, may be brought into agreement by supposing that Aeneas reigns at Lavinium after the expiration of three years in camp, Ascanius removing to Alba after his death, and that Silvius is mentioned here simply as the successor of Ascanius at Alba ; but it seems hardly likely that Virg. should have formed a definite and, in one respect at least, independent conception of events which he alludes to so cursorily.

Henry's objection, that ‘MASK MASK’ in Virg. is restricted to Jupiter, is met by observing that ‘MASK’ here belongs not so much to ‘MASK’ as to ‘MASK MASK’ That the two-crested helmet was distinctive of Mars is, as Henry says, made probable by Val.

Gossrau still pleads for Mummius, contending with considerable ingenuity that Anchises in the preceding couplet has expressed himself in Roman imagery, and now repeats his meaning in words more intelligible to Aeneas, who knew nothing of Corinth or the Capitol, and would only conceive of the conquest of Greece as a victory over the descendants of Achilles or the destruction of the empire of Agamemnon. But Anchises is not elsewhere so considerate to his son's ignorance, referring as he does throughout to Roman exploits in Roman language: nor is it credible that ‘MASK MASK’ should have been used not for an individual but for the descendants of Achilles generally. The argument that if ‘MASK’ &c. v. 840 be referred to any one but Mummius, Virg. virtually denies that Mummius did execute this revenge, needs no refutation. So far as the language is concerned, it would certainly seem that the second ‘MASK’ denotes a different person from the first. The most probable candidate for this honour appears to be L.

We must suppose then that Virg. has written loosely, perhaps conceiving that the indefinite ‘MASK MASK MASK’ exempted him from the need of strict accuracy.

In the case of ‘MASK’ it seems probable from the appearance of the word that the original notion was something like ‘MASK’ This will explain all the instances where it is used with the gen. in the sense of resemblance (comp. “MASK MASK”). There seems no doubt that in some passages (e.g. Suet. Caes. 61, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK”) it means a representation, but it does not appear that there is any trace of this earlier than Livy, so that we need not assume it to be the original notion of the word, at the same time that we can quite account for it as a meaning that may have been attached to it in subsequent usage. Here then it might possibly be taken with Serv. &c. in the sense of ‘MASK MASK’ It is to be observed however that Virg. elsewhere uses the word in connexion with size (2. 15., 3. 637., 7. 707), so that I would rather suppose the meaning to be, with Heyne, ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ which is besides suggested by the context. ‘MASK’ is evidently meant to distinguish him from those about him, so that we should expect some attribute of distinction to be predicated of him, not simple similarity to his ancestor.
