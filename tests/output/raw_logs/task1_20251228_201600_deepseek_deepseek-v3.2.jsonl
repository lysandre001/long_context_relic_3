The excerpt directly states that \"per 'MASK' autem bellum significat, et est tropus metonymia\" (through \"MASK\" he signifies war, and it is the trope metonymy). It then gives examples of how \"arma\" (things used in war) are put for war itself, just as \"toga\" (used in peace) is put for peace.\n\nThe key is to find the very first word(s) of the poem, as the analysis is about why Virgil *begins* (\"coeperit\") with \"arma.\" The opening line of the *Aeneid* is \"Arma virumque cano,\" which starts with \"Arma.\" This is the word under discussion.\n\nTherefore, the window that should replace `<MASK>` to support the claim that \"arma\" signifies war and is the starting point of the poem is the single word **\"Arma\"**.\n\n<<window>Arma</window>>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 11502, "total_tokens": 11743, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.003051279, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00299052, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 9.158e-05}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
