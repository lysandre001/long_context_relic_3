The passage discusses why Virgil began with \"arma\" (arms/weapons)\n2. It mentions that \"arma\" signifies war through metonymy - the things used in war stand for war itself\n3. It contrasts this with \"toga\" which is used in peace standing for peace itself\n4. It references Cicero with a quotation that seems to contrast war and peace\n5. It then discusses why \"arma\" is used literally in this place, noting that it's often joined with \"virum\"\n\nThe key masked quotations appear to be:\n- First MASK: likely \"arma\" (line 1)\n- Second MASK: also \"arma\" (the things used in war)\n- Third MASK group: A Cicero quotation about toga and arms (not from the Aeneid)\n- Fourth MASK: \"arma\" again\n- Fifth and sixth MASK groups: Examples where \"arma\" is joined with \"virum\"\n\nThe most important reference is the opening line where \"arma virumque\" appears together. The analysis specifically mentions \"prope semper armis virum subiungit\" (he almost always joins arms with man/hero).\n\nLooking at line 1: \"ARMA virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris\"\n\nThis is the famous opening line where \"arma\" and \"virum\" are joined together, which is exactly what the literary analysis is discussing.\n\nThe masked quotations referring to examples where arms and man are joined would point to line 1, which is the primary example of \"arma virumque.\"\n\n<line>1</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 14854, "total_tokens": 15253, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.05004153, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.044562, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005985}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
