Why Virgil began with \"arma\" (arms)\n2. That \"arma\" signifies war through metonymy (the weapons used in war stand for war itself)\n3. The contrast with \"toga\" (which represents peace)\n4. That \"arma\" is used appropriately because: the arms were victorious, divine, and Virgil almost always joins \"armis\" with \"virum\"\n5. Examples are given of this pairing\n\nThe key claim is about how Virgil pairs \"arma\" with \"virum\" (man/hero). The literary analysis is clearly discussing the famous opening line of the Aeneid.\n\nThe opening of Aeneid Book 1 is:\n\"Arma virumque cano\"\n\nThis is the exact pairing being referenced when the analysis says \"prope semper armis virum subiungit\" (he almost always joins arms with man).\n\n<text>Arma virumque cano</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.00515592, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.001233, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.003975}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
