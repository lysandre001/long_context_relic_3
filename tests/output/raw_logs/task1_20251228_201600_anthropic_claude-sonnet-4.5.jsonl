Why Virgil began with \"arma\" (arms)\n2. That \"arma\" signifies war through metonymy (the things used in war standing for war itself)\n3. A comparison with \"toga\" (used in peace standing for peace)\n4. That \"arma\" is often joined with \"virum\" (man/men)\n\nThe analysis contains a <MASK> that appears in a context discussing how arms (arma) are used in war, just as toga is used in peace. The reference to Cicero and the phrase structure suggests this is about the relationship between arma and bellum (war).\n\nLooking at the opening of the Aeneid:\n\"ARMA virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris...\"\n\nThe analysis specifically mentions that Virgil \"prope semper armis virum subiungit\" (almost always joins arms with man), giving examples. The most relevant window would be the famous opening phrase that demonstrates this joining of \"arma\" with \"virum.\"\n\nThe window that best supports the literary analysis about \"arma\" being joined with \"virum\" is:\n\n<<window>ARMA virumque</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 12654, "total_tokens": 12970, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04227498, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.037962, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00474}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
