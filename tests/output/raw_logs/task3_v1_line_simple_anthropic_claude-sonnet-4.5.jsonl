The fourth <MASK> is described as \"lectus est qui iam sedes locavit\" (read/chosen is one who has already established a settlement)\n\nThe analysis mentions \"Antenor\" in the context, and looking at the text, I can see Antenor is discussed in lines 242-249. Specifically, line 247 states:\n\n\"Hic tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit\"\n\nThis matches the description \"qui iam sedes locavit\" (who has already established a settlement).\n\nThe key phrase being discussed is \"fato profugus\" from line 2:\n\"Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit\"\n\nLooking at the structure of the commentary:\n- It discusses \"profugus\" from line 2\n- The first MASK likely refers back to \"fato profugus\" \n- The analysis then cites Antenor as an example of someone called \"profugus\" even after settling (line 247)\n\nThe line being primarily analyzed and where the first significant MASK appears is line 2, which contains \"fato profugus.\"\n\n<line>2</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 393, "prompt_tokens": 15031, "total_tokens": 15424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.05047812, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.045093, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005895}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

Reference to something the \"superi\" (gods above) have\n\nLooking at the text, I need to find a passage that:\n- Discusses Juno's anger/impulse against the Trojans\n- Mentions the gods or divine powers\n- Relates to the theme of divine persecution\n\nThe key passage appears early in Book 1, where the narrator asks about the causes of Juno's anger:\n\nLines 8-11:\n\"Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,\nquidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus\ninsignem pietate virum, tot adire labores\nimpulerit. Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?\"\n\nThis translates to asking the Muse to recall the causes - what divine power was injured, or what grieving the queen of gods to drive a man distinguished by piety through so many misfortunes and labors. \"Are there such great angers in celestial minds?\"\n\nThis passage fits perfectly with the analysis discussing:\n- Juno's role (\"regina deum\")\n- The question of divine anger (\"Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?\")\n- The persecution of the Trojans\n- The defense that it wasn't their fault but Juno's impulse (\"impulerit\")\n\nThe second \"MASK MASK\" likely refers to \"animis caelestibus\" (celestial minds/spirits), which the analysis says can mean various divine figures but is better understood as the ira (anger) that the superi (gods above) have.\n\n<line>8</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 496, "prompt_tokens": 14808, "total_tokens": 15304, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.05134536, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.044424, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00744}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
