The analysis states that \"per 'MASK' autem bellum significat\" (through 'MASK' he signifies war) and that \"MASK quibus in bello utimur pro bello posuit\" (MASK, which we use in war, he put for war). The analysis also provides examples of how \"arma\" is used in conjunction with \"virum\" (man) in other lines.\n\nThe opening line of the *Aeneid* is the most famous instance where \"arma\" is used in this metonymic way to begin the epic. The analysis is discussing why Virgil began with \"arma,\" and the quoted examples following \"ut\" (as) are clearly referencing other lines from the *Aeneid* that pair \"arma\" and \"virum.\"\n\nTherefore, the exact text from *aeneid_book1* that replaces `<MASK>` as the primary cited quotation is the epic's first two words, which establish the theme discussed.\n\n<text>Arma virumque cano</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 626, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 320, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0001276758, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 2.436e-05, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00010542}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
