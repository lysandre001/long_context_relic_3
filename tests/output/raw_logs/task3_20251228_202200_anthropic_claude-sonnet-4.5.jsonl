The passage discusses why Virgil began with \"arma\" (arms/weapons)\n2. It mentions that \"arma\" signifies war through metonymy - the things used in war stand for war itself\n3. It contrasts this with \"toga\" which is used in peace standing for peace itself\n4. It references Cicero with a quotation that appears to contrast something with peace\n5. It then discusses why \"arma\" is used literally in this place, noting that it's often joined with \"virum\"\n\nThe key masked quotations appear to be:\n- First MASK: likely \"arma\" (line 1)\n- Second MASK: \"arma\" again (the things used in war)\n- Third MASK sequence: A Cicero quote contrasting war and peace (using \"cedant arma togae\" - \"let arms yield to the toga\")\n- Fourth MASK: \"arma\" again\n- Fifth and sixth MASK sequences: Examples where \"arma\" is joined with \"virum\"\n\nThe most important reference is the opening line where Virgil joins \"arma\" with \"virum\":\n\"ARMA virumque cano\" (line 1)\n\nLooking at the pattern \"MASK MASK MASK\" and \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\", these appear to be examples of \"arma\" being joined with \"virum\". The first clear example is:\n- \"ARMA virumque cano\" (line 1)\n\nThe analysis is discussing the opening of the Aeneid, so the primary reference is to line 1.\n\n<line>1</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 14854, "total_tokens": 15249, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04998213, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.044562, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005925}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
