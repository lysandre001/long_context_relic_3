The fourth <MASK> is described as \"lectus est qui iam sedes locavit\" (read/chosen is one who has already established a settlement)\n\nThe analysis mentions \"Antenor\" in the context, and looking at the text, I can see Antenor is discussed in lines 242-249. Specifically, line 247 states:\n\n\"Hic tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit\"\n\nThis matches the description \"qui iam sedes locavit\" (who has already established a settlement).\n\nThe key phrase being discussed is \"fato profugus\" from line 2:\n\"Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit\"\n\nLooking at the structure of the commentary:\n- It discusses \"profugus\" from line 2\n- The first MASK likely refers back to \"fato profugus\" \n- The analysis then cites Antenor as an example of someone called \"profugus\" even after settling (line 247)\n\nThe line being primarily analyzed and where the first significant MASK appears is line 2, which contains \"fato profugus.\"\n\n<line>2</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 393, "prompt_tokens": 15031, "total_tokens": 15424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.05047812, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.045093, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.005895}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?\"  \n\nBut the example for \"praise\" is likely from elsewhere in Virgil. However, within Book 1, there is a direct example of \"cano\" meaning \"praise\" in line 343: \"Huic coniunx Sychaeus erat, ditissimus agri\" — but that doesn't contain \"cano.\"  \n\nActually, the analysis says: \"aliquando laudo, ut 'MASK MASK'\" — meaning \"sometimes it means 'I praise,' as in '[quotation].'\" The quotation must be two words (since there are two masks), and the first word is likely \"cano\" or a form of it.  \n\nSearching the text, the only place where \"cano\" appears in a praising context is in line 1: \"Arma virumque cano\" — but that is \"I sing,\" not clearly \"I praise.\"  \n\nHowever, in the *Aeneid*, a famous example of \"cano\" meaning \"praise\" is from *Eclogues*, not Book 1. But since only Book 1 is provided, maybe the example is from Book 1 after all.  \n\nLooking carefully, there is no clear \"cano\" meaning \"praise\" in Book 1 except possibly in a different sense. But the analysis might be referencing a line from *Aeneid* Book 6 or elsewhere. Since only Book 1 is given, perhaps the example is not from Book 1.  \n\nWait — the task says: \"identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in aeneid_book1.\" So the quotation must be in Book 1.  \n\nSearching for \"cano\" in the text:  \nLine 1: \"Arma virumque cano\" — this is \"I sing.\"  \nLine 740: \"personat aurata, docuit quem maximus Atlas.\" — no \"cano.\"  \nLine 742: \"Hic canit errantem lunam solisque labores;\" — \"canit\" from \"cano,\" meaning \"sings.\"  \n\nBut the analysis says \"aliquando laudo\" — \"sometimes it means 'praise.'\" Where in Book 1 is \"cano\" used to mean \"praise\"? Possibly in line 742: \"Hic canit errantem lunam...\" — but that's \"sings,\" not clearly \"praises.\"  \n\nMaybe the praising example is from a different work, but the instruction says the literary analysis cites *aeneid_book1*. So the example must be in Book 1.  \n\nLooking at the structure: the analysis gives three examples:  \n1. \"aliquando laudo, ut 'MASK MASK'\" — two words.  \n2. \"aliquando divino, ut 'MASK MASK MASK'\" — three words.  \n3. \"aliquando canto, ut in hoc loco\" — referring to the current passage (likely *Aeneid* 1.1).  \n\nSo the first MASK MASK is a two-word example of \"cano\" meaning \"praise.\" In Virgil, a known example is \"Caesaris altum cano nomen\" or similar, but not in Book 1.  \n\nSearching Book 1 text for a two-word phrase that could mean \"I praise [something]\" — maybe \"laudibus cano\" or \"virtutes cano.\" Not found.  \n\nPerhaps the example is from *Aeneid* Book 1, line 607–608: \"semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt\" — but no \"cano.\"  \n\nGiven the constraints, the only occurrence of \"cano\" in Book 1 is in line 1 (\"cano\") and line 742 (\"canit\"). The example for \"praise\" might be from line 1 interpreted as praise, but that's a stretch.  \n\nHowever, in the analysis, the example for \"sing\" is \"in hoc loco\" — meaning the current passage being analyzed, which is likely *Aeneid* 1.1. So the first MASK MASK might be from elsewhere in Virgil, but since only Book 1 is provided, maybe it's not in Book 1. But the task says \"identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in aeneid_book1.\" So it must be in Book 1.  \n\nMaybe the first MASK MASK is \"cano\" plus an object, like \"arma cano\" — but that's from line 1. But that's not two words; it's three (\"Arma virumque cano\").  \n\nUnless the two masks are \"virumque cano\" — but that doesn't make sense as \"I praise.\"  \n\nGiven the difficulty, I'll check the context: the analysis is about the word \"cano.\" The first example is for \"praise,\" second for \"prophesy,\" third for \"sing.\" The third is \"in hoc loco\" — meaning here, in the text being analyzed, which is *Aeneid* 1.1. So the first two examples are likely from other works, but the instruction says the literary analysis cites *aeneid_book1*. So maybe both examples are from Book 1.  \n\nSearching for \"cano\" meaning \"prophesy\" — maybe in line 742: \"Hic canit errantem lunam...\" — but that's \"sings,\" not \"prophesies.\"  \n\nWait, the second example is \"aliquando divino, ut 'MASK MASK MASK'\" — three words. Could be \"fata cano\" or something.  \n\nGiven the time, I'll assume the first MASK MASK is from line 1: \"Arma virumque\" is not two words. Maybe it's \"cano\" alone, but that's one word.  \n\nPerhaps the example is \"laudes cano\" — but not in Book 1.  \n\nGiven the text, the only plausible answer for the first example (praise) is from line 1, but it's not two words. Maybe it's \"virum cano\" — but not present.  \n\nGiven the constraints, I'll guess the first example is from line 1, but since it's two masks, maybe it's \"arma virumque\" — but that's three words.  \n\nActually, looking at the text, line 1: \"ARMA virumque cano\" — \"cano\" is the verb. The example for \"praise\" might be \"arma cano\" — but that's not in the text as two consecutive words.  \n\nGiven the difficulty, I'll look for where \"cano\" might mean \"praise\" in a two-word phrase in Book 1. There is none.  \n\nMaybe the analysis is citing a different part of Virgil, but the task says the literary analysis cites *aeneid_book1*. So perhaps the example is not in Book 1, but the instruction says to identify where it appears in Book 1. This is contradictory.  \n\nGiven the only occurrence of \"cano\" in Book 1 is line 1 and line 742, and line 1 is likely the example for \"sing,\" the example for \"praise\" might be from elsewhere. But the task says \"missing quotation appears in aeneid_book1.\" So maybe both examples are from Book 1.  \n\nLine 742: \"Hic canit errantem lunam solisque labores\" — \"canit\" is from \"cano,\" meaning \"sings.\" That could be the example for \"sing,\" but the analysis says \"ut in hoc loco\" for \"sing,\" meaning the current passage. So the current passage is *Aeneid* 1.1.  \n\nThus, the first MASK MASK might be from another work, but since only Book 1 is given, perhaps it's not in Book 1. But the task says to identify where it appears in Book 1.  \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume the first example is from line 1, but it's not two words. Maybe the two masks are \"Arma virumque\" — but that's the object, not the verb.  \n\nGiven the time, I'll answer with line 1, since \"cano\" appears there and the analysis is about \"cano.\"  \n\nBut the analysis has three examples: praise, prophesy, sing. The sing example is \"in hoc loco\" — so the first two examples are from elsewhere in Virgil.

This suggests the quotation is a phrase where Virgil omitted a preposition that would normally be used with “silvis” (woods/forest).  \n\nLooking at the Aeneid Book 1 text, the phrase that matches this description is “errantem silvis” in line 755, where Aeneas is described as wandering “through lands and floods” but the Latin omits “in” before “silvis.”  \n\nThe full line is:  \n755 “omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas.”  \nBut earlier in the same sentence (line 754–755), Dido asks Aeneas to tell about his wanderings:  \n754 “insidias,” inquit, ‘Danaum, casusque tuorum,  \n755 **erroresque tuos; nam te iam septima portat**  \n756 **omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas.**”  \n\nHowever, the literary analysis example “pro in silvis” likely refers to a different passage. Searching for “silvis” in the text:  \nLine 384: “Libyae deserta peragro, / Europa atque Asia pulsus.” — no “silvis” here.  \nLine 310: “Classem in convexo nemorum sub rupe cavata / arboribus clausam circum atque horrentibus umbris / occulit;” — not “silvis” exactly.  \nLine 430–436: simile of bees “per florea rura” — not “silvis.”  \n\nBut the literary analysis says Vergilius wrote “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” pro in silvis. That likely means the masked quotation is a phrase where “silvis” appears without “in.”  \n\nThe only instance of “silvis” in Book 1 is line 310 (“nemorum”) and line 693 (“Idaliae lucos”), but “silvis” itself appears in line 755? Wait — no, line 755 says “terris et fluctibus,” not “silvis.”  \n\nActually, the literary analysis may be quoting from another part of the Aeneid, but the prompt says “directly cites aeneid_book1.” So it must be in Book 1.  \n\nLooking at line 755–756: “omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas” — no “silvis.” But earlier in line 384: “Ipse ignotus, egens, Libyae deserta peragro, / Europa atque Asia pulsus.” — no “silvis.”  \n\nBut the literary analysis example “pro in silvis” could refer to a phrase like “errantem terris” (without “in”) but they wrote “silvis” in the commentary. Possibly they misremembered “terris” as “silvis.”  \n\nGiven the clues:  \n- The literary analysis says Vergilius wrote “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” pro in silvis.  \n- In Book 1, the only phrase that fits “errantem [ablative plural]” is line 756 “omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas.”  \n- But “terris” is not “silvis.”  \n\nWait — maybe the quotation is from another part of the Aeneid, but the prompt says “directly cites aeneid_book1.” So it must be in Book 1.  \n\nSearching for “silvis” in Book 1 text: it doesn’t appear. So maybe the literary analysis is quoting from another book, but the prompt says “aeneid_book1.” Possibly a mistake?  \n\nGiven the evidence, the literary analysis example “pro in silvis” likely refers to Aeneid 1.755–756 “omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas” — but “terris” not “silvis.” However, the literary analysis may have misquoted “silvis” for “terris.”  \n\nThus, the masked quotation is “omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas” which spans lines 755–756.  \n\nThe starting line is 755.\n\n<line>755</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 934, "prompt_tokens": 10227, "total_tokens": 11161, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0029930472, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00265902, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00036426}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The phrases like \"MASK MASK\" and the longer \"MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK\" suggest the missing quotation is a repeated word or short phrase.\n\nIn the *Aeneid* Book 1 text provided, a likely candidate for such a discussion is the repetition of \"MASK\" (which would be a Latin word). A common example in Vergil of a word repeated for metrical filling or archaic style is \"O\" (interjection) or \"et\" (and). However, the analysis mentions \"hoc loco abundat\" (here it is redundant) and \"interposita particula propter metri necessitatem\" (a particle inserted because of metrical necessity).\n\nA famous line in *Aeneid* 1 that fits this is line 94:  \n**\"O terque quaterque beati\"**  \nHere \"O\" is an interjection that could be seen as metrically filling. But the analysis seems to quote a longer repeated phrase.\n\nLooking at the longer masked sequence:  \n“MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK“ — that’s 8 masks, possibly representing 8 syllables or 4 words of two syllables each.\n\nA likely match is line 95–96:  \n**\"quis ante ora patrum Troiae sub moenibus altis\"**  \nBut that’s 9 syllables in Latin.  \n\nAlternatively, consider the repetition of \"MASK MASK\" earlier in the analysis. The critic says if you remove 'MASK', the sense still stands, and 'MASK MASK' can be applied to everything. This sounds like the double \"et\" (and) or perhaps \"–que ... –que\".\n\nIn line 3 of *Aeneid* 1, we have:  \n**\"multum ille et terris iactatus et alto\"**  \nHere \"et ... et\" (both...and) could be seen as the repeated particle. If you remove one \"et\", the sense remains, but it’s there for meter and style.\n\nBut the critic gives an example from another place:  \n“MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK“ — 7 masks, maybe 7 syllables.\n\nA known archaic or noble-style repetition in *Aeneid* is in line 8:  \n**\"Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso\"**  \nBut no obvious repeated particle.\n\nThe most plausible match for a repeated particle inserted for meter in Book 1 is in line 3: **\"et terris iactatus et alto\"** — the double \"et\".  \nIf we take \"MASK\" = \"et\", then \"MASK MASK\" = \"et et\" (the two 'et's).  \nThe critic says: 'MASK' hoc loco abundat; est enim interposita particula propter metri necessitatem, ut stet versus : nam si detrahas 'MASK', stat sensus ; 'MASK MASK' enim ad omnia possumus trahere.  \nThat fits: \"et\" here is redundant; it's inserted for metrical necessity so the verse stands; if you remove \"et\", the sense remains; \"et et\" we can apply to all things (i.e., the correlative \"both...and\").\n\nThus the line number is line 3.\n\n<line>3</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 766, "prompt_tokens": 12441, "total_tokens": 13207, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0034904826, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00323466, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00029108}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

MASK bene duorum elementorum mala uno sermone conplexus est.\" This suggests the missing quotation is about being tossed on the sea by waves and wearied, and that it combines the evils of two elements (sea and wind) in one phrase.\n\nIn Aeneid Book 1, the description of the storm sent by Juno via Aeolus fits this context. Specifically, lines 81–91 describe the winds rushing out and causing a storm at sea, and lines 92–101 show Aeneas’s reaction. The phrase that combines the evils of two elements (sea and wind) in one expression is likely from Aeneas’s speech where he laments his fate at sea.\n\nThe key line that matches “iactamur autem in mari fluctibus, fatigamur in [MASK]” is line 3, where Aeneas is introduced as “multum ille et terris iactatus et alto” — tossed on land and sea. But the analysis seems to quote a line where Aeneas says “iactamur” (we are tossed) in the plural, which fits lines 332–333, where Aeneas tells Venus (disguised): “ventō hūc vāstīs et flūctibus āctī” (driven here by the vast winds and waves). However, the exact phrase that combines both wind and wave evils in one expression is in line 3: “iactatus et alto” (tossed on the deep). But the analysis uses “iactamur” (first person plural), which is not in line 3.\n\nThe closest match in sense and context for the storm in Book 1 is Aeneas’s exclamation in lines 94–96, but the specific phrase that fits “duorum elementorum mala uno sermone conplexus est” (combined the evils of two elements in one phrase) is likely line 3: “multum ille et terris iactatus et alto” — tossed on both land and sea (two elements). However, the analysis says “in mari fluctibus, fatigamur in [MASK]” — so the missing quotation might be “et terris iactatus et alto” or similar.\n\nBut the literary analysis explicitly says “tempestate vero MASK in primo” — so the missing quotation is the description of the storm in Book 1. The most famous storm description in Book 1 begins around line 81, but the phrase that encapsulates being battered by sea and wind is in Aeneas’s speech at line 3.\n\nGiven the clues, the quotation likely is “et terris iactatus et alto” from line 3, which combines land and sea. But the analysis uses plural “iactamur” — maybe it’s a paraphrase. However, in the actual text, the line that matches being tossed by waves and wind in one phrase is line 3.\n\nBut let’s check line 332: “ventō hūc vāstīs et flūctibus āctī” — driven by wind and waves. That also combines two elements. However, the analysis says “MASK bene duorum elementorum mala uno sermone conplexus est” — “he skillfully combined the evils of two elements in one phrase.” That could refer to line 3 or line 332.\n\nGiven the literary analysis is citing “in primo” (in the first book) for the storm, and the most programmatic statement of Aeneas’s suffering on land and sea is line 3, that is the likely answer.\n\nThus, the line number is 3.\n\n<line>3</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 846, "prompt_tokens": 12397, "total_tokens": 13243, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.00363646107, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.003334793, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0003384}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The phrase given is \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" — four words. In the Aeneid text, a known example of this rhetorical device is \"arma virumque cano\" (line 1), but that’s only three words. However, the analysis likely refers to a passive sense expressed with active verbs.\n\nA common example from Aeneid 1 is \"tendimus in Latium\" (line 205) — but that’s only three words.  \nAnother candidate is \"Troiae qui primus ab oris\" (line 1) — four words, but not clearly passive-for-active.\n\nBut the next example in the analysis is \"pro passivis activa\" (passive forms used with active meaning), also four words.  \nThen an adverb example: \"MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK\" — seven words, \"pro huc\" (instead of \"huc\").  \nThen a participle example: \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" — four words, \"pro qua vehebatur\" (instead of \"which was carried\").\n\nThe participle example \"pro qua vehebatur\" likely refers to a passive participle used actively. In Aeneid 1, line 113: \"Unam, quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\" — here \"vehebat\" is active (\"was carrying\"), but the sense could be passive (\"in which he was carried\"). That’s four words: \"fidumque vehebat Oronten\"? No, that’s three. But \"Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\" is four words if \"Lycios\" is one. Actually \"Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\" is four: Lycios, fidumque, vehebat, Oronten.\n\nBut the text says \"pro qua vehebatur\" — so the passive \"vehebatur\" is replaced by active \"vehebat\" in the quote. That fits line 113: \"quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\" — four words: \"Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\".\n\nThus, the participle example likely comes from line 113.\n\nChecking the adverb example: seven words \"pro huc\" — maybe \"huc pauci vestris adnavimus oris\" (line 538) — that’s six words. Or \"Huc septem Aeneas collectis navibus omni\" (line 170) — also six. But maybe \"per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum\" (line 204) — seven words? That’s seven: \"per, varios, casus, per, tot, discrimina, rerum\" — but not obviously \"pro huc\".\n\nGiven the task asks for the missing quotation in the literary analysis, and the first masked one is four words, \"pro activis passiva\", I suspect it’s \"Troiae qui primus ab oris\" (line 1), but that’s not clearly passive-for-active.\n\nActually, the analysis says: \"constat multa in auctoribus inveniri per contrarium significantia : pro activis passiva , ut “MASK MASK MASK MASK“ ; pro passivis activa , ut “MASK MASK MASK MASK“.\"\n\nSo the first masked quote is an active form used with passive meaning. In Vergil, a famous example is \"Troiae qui primus ab oris\" — but that’s not obviously passive. Another is \"Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit litora\" — but that’s more than four words.\n\nMaybe \"multum ille et terris iactatus et alto\" (line 3) — but that’s passive participle, not active verb.\n\nGiven the participle example is explicitly \"pro qua vehebatur\" and matches line 113, I’ll focus on that.\n\nThe question asks: \"identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in aeneid_book1.\" The participle example is clearly from line 113.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<line>113</line>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 856, "prompt_tokens": 10188, "total_tokens": 11044, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0029528928, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00264888, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00033384}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
