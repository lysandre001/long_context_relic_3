Why Virgil began with \"arma\" (arms)\n2. That \"arma\" signifies war through metonymy (the weapons used in war stand for war itself)\n3. The contrast with \"toga\" (which represents peace)\n4. That \"arma\" is used appropriately because: the arms were victorious, divine, and Virgil almost always joins \"armis\" with \"virum\"\n5. Examples are given of this pairing\n\nThe key claim is about how Virgil pairs \"arma\" with \"virum\" (man/hero). The literary analysis is clearly discussing the famous opening line of the Aeneid.\n\nLooking at the structure of the argument, the excerpt needs the opening words of the Aeneid, which famously begins:\n\n<text>arma virumque cano</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 641, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.00463617, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.001233, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00345}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
