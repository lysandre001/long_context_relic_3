It only shows \"contra Turnum .\" which means \"against Turnus\" in Latin. \n\nLooking through the full text of Aeneid Book 1, I need to search for references that would make sense in a context discussing something \"against Turnus\" or in opposition to Turnus.\n\nSearching through the text, I find that Turnus is not actually mentioned in Book 1 of the Aeneid. Turnus becomes a major character later in the epic as Aeneas's opponent in Italy.\n\nHowever, there is a passage where Jupiter prophesies future events, including conflicts in Italy. In Jupiter's prophecy to Venus, he mentions:\n\n\"bellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces contundet\"\n\nThis refers to the great war Aeneas will wage in Italy against fierce peoples, which would include Turnus, though Turnus is not named here.\n\nGiven the fragment \"contra Turnum\" and looking for what might be said in opposition to or concerning Turnus in a prophetic or contextual sense, the most relevant phrase from Book 1 would be from Jupiter's prophecy about the wars in Italy.\n\n<<window>bellum ingens geret Italia</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 12450, "total_tokens": 12776, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0418176, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.03735, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00489}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
