That this is contrasted with \"toga\" (used in peace standing for peace)\n4. Examples where \"arma\" is joined with \"virum\" (man/men)\n\nLooking at the opening of the Aeneid:\n\"ARMA virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris...\"\n\nThe analysis mentions that Virgil \"prope semper armis virum subiungit\" (almost always joins arma with virum), and the examples given would be instances of this pairing.\n\nThe key window being discussed is clearly the famous opening phrase where \"arma\" appears with \"virum\":\n\n<<window>ARMA virumque</window>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 12654, "total_tokens": 12897, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.04119093, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.037962, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.003645}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
