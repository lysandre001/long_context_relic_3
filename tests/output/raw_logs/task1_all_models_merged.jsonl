The excerpt then says some interpreters want to solve this question by having Virgil add a specific phrase (\"MASK MASK MASK\") to avoid implying Antenor was in Italy. The phrase in question must be one that clarifies the geographical distinction.\n\nLooking at the full text, the relevant passage about Antenor is in Venus's speech to Jupiter (lines 242-249).

The text reads:  \n\"**Illyricos penetrare sinus, atque intima tutus / regna Liburnorum, et fontem superare Timavi**\"  \nThis describes Antenor reaching Illyrian gulfs and the innermost realms of the Liburnians, past the Timavus river—all regions northeast of Italy proper at the time.\n\nTherefore, the exact text that best replaces the triple <MASK> to support the claim that Virgil added it to specify Antenor did *not* come to Italy is the geographical description of where Antenor went.\n\n<text>Illyricos penetrare sinus, atque intima tutus regna Liburnorum, et fontem superare Timavi</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 11511, "total_tokens": 11884, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0033385572, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00322308, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0001492}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

This is a poetic reference to the coastal land of Latium.\n\nThe longer masked quote (`'MASK MASK MASK'`) attributed to Book 4 in the analysis is not in Book 1, so we focus on the first masked quote, which is from Book 1. The phrase \"Laviniaque ... litora\" is the key.\n\nThus, the exact text from Aeneid Book 1 that replaces the first `<MASK>` is **\"litora Lavinia\"** (though in the text it appears across a line break as \"Laviniaque venit litora\"). The most precise selection for the citation is the two-word phrase referring to the shores.\n\n<text>litora Lavinia</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 490, "prompt_tokens": 11409, "total_tokens": 11899, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 11200, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0005439168, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00037212, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0002058}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

The analysis mentions that if you remove this particle, the sense remains, and it can be applied broadly (\"ad omnia possumus trahere\").\n\nThe most likely candidate is the archaic particle \"**-que**\" (meaning \"and\"), which is frequently used in epic poetry for metrical reasons and to create a formal, elevated tone. However, the excerpt seems to be quoting a specific line where this is exemplified. Looking at the text, a prominent and famous line that uses \"-que\" in a way that could be seen as metrically necessary and grand is the very first line, which establishes the epic's theme and heroic subject.\n\nThe line is: **\"ARMA virumque cano\"** (\"I sing of arms and the man\"). Here, the \"-que\" connects \"arma\" (arms) and \"virum\" (the man). If you removed \"-que,\" the core sense \"I sing of arms, the man\" still stands, though the connection is awkward.

The key phrases are \"tempestate vero MASK in primo\" (but by a storm in the first [book]) and \"iactamur autem in mari fluctibus , fatigamur in MASK\" (moreover we are tossed on the sea by waves, we are wearied in MASK). The analysis then states that the author (Virgil) has skillfully encompassed the evils of two elements (sea and wind) in one phrase.\n\nThe cited quotation must therefore be a single phrase from Book 1 describing a storm at sea that involves both waves and winds. In the provided text of Aeneid Book 1, the most fitting description that combines these two elemental evils is when Aeneas's fleet is struck by the storm unleashed by Juno and Aeolus. The specific line that concisely captures being tossed on waves and battered by winds is Aeneas's lament about his sufferings.\n\nThe line is: **\"multum ille et terris iactatus et alto\"** (much buffeted on land and sea). However, this is about his overall journey. The analysis points to a specific storm scene. A more precise match for the context of being tossed by waves (\"fluctibus\") and wearied is found in the description of the storm's immediate effect on the Trojans: **\"fluctibus oppressos Troas caelique ruina\"** (the Trojans overwhelmed by the waves and the downfall of the sky). But the analysis suggests a single, compact phrase.\n\nThe phrase that best fits the claim \"MASK bene duorum elementorum mala uno sermone conplexus est\" (MASK has skillfully encompassed the evils of two elements in one phrase) is likely the one where Aeneas summarizes their suffering from both sea and sky/wind in a single, memorable line. That line is Aeneas's cry: **\"O terque quaterque beati, / quis ante ora patrum Troiae sub moenibus altis / contigit oppetere!\"** but that doesn't name the elements. The phrase that directly names the two elements (land and sea) in one compact unit is the very first description of Aeneas's suffering: **\"multum ille et terris iactatus et alto\"**.\n\nGiven the analysis mentions \"in primo\" (in the first book) and the storm is the major event of Book 1, the most iconic and compact phrase summarizing the suffering from the two elements (land and sea, though the analysis interprets as sea and wind) is indeed the opening line's description. However, a more storm-specific phrase is **\"iactatos aequore toto\"** (tossed over the whole sea) from line 30, but it doesn't explicitly include the second element.\n\nThe analysis's final sentence praises the compression of two elements' evils into one phrase. The phrase that does this most famously and is from Book 1 is **\"et terris iactatus et alto\"** (and tossed on lands and on the deep sea). This perfectly fits \"duorum elementorum mala\" (the evils of two elements—land and sea).\n\nTherefore, the exact text that replaces <MASK> as the cited quotation for the storm in Book 1 is:\n\n<text>multum ille et terris iactatus et alto</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 719, "prompt_tokens": 11382, "total_tokens": 12101, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 11200, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0006316506, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00036456, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.00030198}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}

It mentions that many say \"MASK MASK\" could refer to Iris, Aeolus, Iuturna, Juno, but it's better judged as \"MASK\" which the gods above have.\n\nThe phrase \"MASK MASK\" likely needs to be a two-word quotation, and the following \"MASK\" a one-word quotation. Looking through the Aeneid Book 1 text, the section that directly shows Juno inciting another divine power against the Trojans is her speech to Aeolus, asking him to unleash the winds. The key line where she explicitly asks him to attack the Trojan fleet is: **\"incute vim ventis submersasque obrue puppes\"** (\"Lash fury into your winds, sink and overwhelm the ships\").\n\nThis fits the analysis: Juno (one of the \"superi\") is the instigator, and the quotation shows her direct impulse against the Trojans.\n\nThus, the selected text for the first set of masks (the 12 masks) is the full line Juno speaks to Aeolus, which includes that command. However, the analysis seems to break it into a two-word quote and a one-word quote.

First, it claims that \"saevam\" (referring to Juno) was used to mean \"great\" rather than \"cruel.\" Second, it claims that \"pius\" (referring to Aeneas) was used to mean \"great\" as well. The excerpt then provides an example from Ennius and states that Vergilius (Virgil) does the same, citing a line where he calls Aeneas \"pius\" but in a context meaning \"magnus.\"\n\nLooking at the provided text of Aeneid Book 1, the line that most directly supports this claim is the very first description of Aeneas in the epic's opening. The analysis says: \"item Vergilius cum ubique pium inducat Aeneam, ait 'MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK', id est magnus.\" This indicates a five-word quotation where Virgil calls Aeneas \"pius\" in a way that means \"great.\"\n\nThe most famous and foundational instance of Aeneas being called \"pius\" is in the opening lines, where he is introduced as the central figure.

It fits the five-word length specified in the mask and is the primary example of Virgil labeling Aeneas with a word related to \"pietas\" (pius/pietate).

It gives examples, including one where an adverb is used for another adverb, specifically \"MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK\" for \"huc\" (meaning \"to here\"). It also mentions a participle example: \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" for \"qua vehebatur\" (\"by which she was carried\").\n\nLooking at the full text of Aeneid Book 1, the line that matches this description of an adverb used in place of \"huc\" is found when Aeneas and Achates are approaching Carthage. Venus, disguised, gives them directions and says:  \n**\"Perge modo, et, qua te ducit via, dirige gressum.\"**  \nThis means \"Go on, and direct your steps where the way leads you.\" The adverb **\"quo\"** (to where) is implied by the relative clause \"qua te ducit via,\" but the analysis seems to refer to a line where an adverb is used for \"huc.\" A more direct match is the line just before, where Venus says:  \n**\"haud aliter puppesque tuae pubesque tuorum aut portum tenet aut pleno subit ostia velo.\"**  \nHowever, the example that fits the pattern of an adverb substitution is likely the imperative with an implied direction.\n\nThe clearest match in the text for an adverb used in place of \"huc\" is actually:  \n**\"Huc septem Aeneas collectis navibus omni ex numero subit\"**  \nBut this uses \"huc\" directly, not a substitution. The analysis says \"ut est 'MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK' pro huc,\" meaning the masked text is used *instead of* \"huc.\" Therefore, we need a phrase that indicates direction (\"to here\") but uses different wording.\n\nThe line that best fits is when Ilioneus pleads with Dido:  \n**\"huc pauci vestris adnavimus oris.\"**  \nThis means \"to here a few of us have swum to your shores.\" Here, **\"huc\"** is used explicitly, so it doesn't match the \"pro huc\" (instead of huc) clue. The analysis example must be a phrase that means \"to here\" without using \"huc.\"\n\nReviewing the text, the directional phrase that substitutes for \"huc\" is:  \n**\"ad navis\"** or **\"ad litora\"**, but these are prepositions. The likely candidate from the narrative is when Aeneas sends Achates to the ships:  \n**\"rapidum ad navis praemittit Achaten\"**  \nBut this means \"to the ships,\" not \"to here.\"\n\nGiven the analysis's structure, the example for the adverb is likely a longer phrase. The line that fits the seven-word mask for an adverb meaning \"to here\" is:  \n**\"qua te ducit via, dirige gressum\"**  \nBut this is only six words in Latin. The seven-word phrase that means \"to this place\" is:  \n**\"huc pauci vestris adnavimus oris\"** (5 words).  \nPerhaps the mask includes the preceding word: **\"adnavimus oris\"** is short.\n\nLooking at the participle example: \"MASK MASK MASK MASK\" pro \"qua vehebatur\" (\"by which she was carried\"). In the text, this refers to the ship that carried Orontes. The line is:  \n**\"Unam, quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\"**  \nThis means \"One, which was carrying the Lycians and faithful Orontes.\" Here, **\"vehebat\"** is active (\"was carrying\") but is used in a passive sense relative to Orontes (he was carried). This matches the analysis: a passive meaning expressed with an active verb form.\n\nThus, the participle example is clearly: **\"quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\"**.\n\nFor the adverb example, the analysis says \"ut est 'MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK' pro huc.\" Searching for a seven-word phrase that means \"to here/this place,\" one candidate is when Aeneas arrives at the shore:  \n**\"egressi optata potiuntur Troes harena\"**  \nBut this doesn't mean \"to here.\" The phrase that indicates coming to a place is:  \n**\"Libyae vertuntur ad oras\"** (they turn to the shores of Libya).  \nHowever, the seven-word phrase that best matches is likely the one where the Trojans seek the nearest shore:  \n**\"quae proxima litora, cursu contendunt petere\"**  \nBut this is not exactly \"pro huc.\"\n\nGiven the complexity, the most certain match from the analysis is the participle example. Since the instruction asks for the text that exactly best supports the claims, and the participle example is clearly identifiable, I will provide that.\n\nThe analysis states: \"et in participio, ut 'MASK MASK MASK MASK' pro qua vehebatur.\" The corresponding line in the text is:  \n**\"quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten\"**.\n\n<text>quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten</text>", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1170, "prompt_tokens": 11521, "total_tokens": 12691, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "image_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 11200, "video_tokens": 0}, "cost": 0.0008577072, "is_byok": false, "cost_details": {"upstream_inference_cost": null, "upstream_inference_prompt_cost": 0.00040348, "upstream_inference_completions_cost": 0.0004914}}, "status": "ok", "error": null}
