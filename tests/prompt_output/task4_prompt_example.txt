You are provided an excerpt of literary analysis that directly cites aeneid_book1 with the cited quotation represented as <MASK>.
Your task is to carefully reference the text of aeneid_book1 and the excerpt of literary analysis, then identify the traditional line number(s) where the missing quotation appears in aeneid_book1.
<literary_analysis_excerpt>This line is preceded in some MSS. by the following verses, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” They are not found in Med., Rom., Gud., or the Verona fragments (Pal. and the fragments of Vat. and St. Gall seem to fail here), and the only MS. in Ribbeck's list which contains them (the Berne MS. No. 172) has them written in the margin by a later hand. They appear to have existed in the time of Servius and of the Pseudo-Donatus, who say that Nisus the grammarian had heard a story of their having been expunged by Tueca and Varius; on which Heyne remarks, “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” The external evidence of such a story it is impossible to estimate, but its existence suspiciously indicates that the lines were felt to require apology. Those who speak of them as an introduction to the poem, forget that if genuine they are an integral part of the first sentence; and that it is, to say the least, remarkable that the exordium should be so constructed as to be at once interwoven with the context, and yet capable of removal without detriment to the construction, just at the point which forms a much better commencement. The words ‘MASK MASK’ are quoted by Martial, 8. 56., 19. 14., 185. 2, and Auson. Epig. 137. 1, evidently as a real commencement of the Aeneid; while Ovid, Trist. 2. 533, and Persius, 1. 96, quote ‘MASK MASK MASK’ or ‘MASK MASK MASK’ as important and independent words, which they cease to be the moment ‘MASK’ is viewed in connexion with the words supposed to precede it. Virg. himself, 9. 777, has (of the poet Clytins) “MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK” Comp. also MASK , Prop. 3. 26. 63, which point the same way. Macrob. Sat. 5. 2. quotes ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as part of the first verse of the Aeneid. On the other hand Priscian 910 P cites ‘MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK MASK’ as Virg.'s. Henry's view that ‘MASK MASK’ is happily contrasted with ‘MASK MASK’ (comp. MASK ) seems to be favoured by the structure of the sentence, and may very possibly have been present to the mind of the author of these lines; but it clearly was not present to the minds of those who quoted ‘MASK’ by itself as war . Tastes may differ as to the rival commencements, on which see Henry in loco, and on 2. 247; but it may be suggested that Virg. would scarcely in his first sentence have divided the attention of the reader between himself and his hero by saying, in effect, that the poet who wrote the Eclogues and the Georgics, sings the hero who founded Rome . Wagn. and Forb., however, as well as Henry, consider the lines as genuine; and they have been imitated by Spenser in the opening of the Faery Queene, and Milton in the opening of Paradise Regained.</literary_analysis_excerpt>
